This is a project analyzing the correlation between :
  - The approval rating of Joe Biden
  - The sentimental analysis of 10000 briefings from the White House
Findings : There seems to be some correlation between the mood of the briefings and the approval ratings. This can be seen in the Robera_neutral and Roberta_Pos with the positive approval rating
We can conclude that while there are some correlation, but the correlation is not strong enough to be utilized on its own. 


Tools used : 
  - The Jupyter notebook suite (Pandas/Matlab/Seaborn/Numpy)
