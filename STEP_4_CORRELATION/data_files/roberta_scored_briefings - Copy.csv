EDT,THE PRESIDENT:  I think I should leave now.  (Applause.),Thank you, thank you, thank you.,By the way, she was 25, and I was — I was — just so you know, I was — I was under 35.  (Laughter.)  I used to be — she used to be just — anyway, now she’s 25 years younger than I am.  I don’t know how that happened.  (Laughter.),Folks, look, Lizanne and Barry, thank you very much for hosting us.  But more importantly, thank you for your friendship.  It’s great to see so many friends who’ve been with me for a long, long time.,Three great members of Congress: Dan, Tom, and Adriano.  Where are — where you guys?  Did you — still — there — thanks, fellas.  (Applause.)  No way out, huh?,This is what we call in our business a busman’s holiday, having to come hear another politician speak.,Look, another friend, Bonnie — where — where’s Bonnie?  Bonnie, I want to tell you — Bonnie Lautenberg — Frank Lautenberg, we both miss him dearly.  And one of the things I was able to do before he passed and when he passed was — honored him posthumously, bestowed the Medal of Freedom on him.  And, Bonnie — (applause) — you’ve been a great friend for a long time.,It’s great to see Howard Stern here.  Where is Howard?  How could I miss Howard?  Anyway, he was here a moment ago.  Anyway, it was great to see him, and I had a great time on his show.  And I’m actually going to take a chance in going back.  (Laughter.),Look, I’d like to make three points today.,First, thank you all for your support.  And I really mean it.  It’s making a real difference in building a campaign to win.  In fact, today, we announced, just since the debate, we’ve raised — just since the debate, raised $27 million, the strongest stretch — (applause) — since our campaign started.  And we’re on track for a very strong June.,Second, but I understand the concern about the debate.  I get it.  I didn’t have a great night.  But here’s what I — not getting reported: Voters had a different reaction than the pundits.  Since the debate, polls show a little movement, and we’ve moved us up, actually.  Research on the debate shows it can — you know, all those folks on the edge, converting more undecided voters.  Well, we converted more undecided voters than Trump did, especially on January 6th and who’s fighting for the working class, the middle class.,He — and, by the way, the Times had their editorial.  Well, guess what?  They also pointed out he lied 28 times in a matter of 90 minutes.  That’s pretty good.  That’s pretty good.  (Laughter.),But the big takeaway were his lies.  People remembered how bad things were during his presidency, how much they disliked him.  They don’t like the chaos and extremism that he brought.  His answer to abortion and January 6th did a lot of damage to his position — a lot of damage.,He also lied about how great he was with veterans.  Well, then I told him how he had called the veterans who had given their lives in a cemetery in,Italy,[France] — he wouldn’t go to the cemetery, and — because he said they’re a bunch of “suckers” and “losers.”  Well, our son was one of those people — not in,Italy,[France] but in Iraq — and he died.,Well, guess what?  He tried to deny it.  But let me ask you this: Are you going to believe a four-star Marine general and his own chief of staff, John Kelly, who told us that’s exactly what Trump said, or a disgraced, defeated president, liar like Trump?,It’s about the fact that — think about this — 40 of his 44 top advisors in his administration refuse to endorse him — 40 out of 44, including his vice president.  And they refuse to support him this time.  It tells you a hell of a lot about the man they worked for.,The point is, I didn’t have a great night but neither did Trump.  We’ve long believed the more voters focus on choice and better than focusing on just what we have.,Look, I — I get kidded for saying: Don’t compare me to the Almighty; compare me to the alternative.  Well, that’s not a hard fight.  That’s not a hard fight.,Third, I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job.  I know I don’t walk as easy I used to, I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to, I don’t debate as well as I used to.  But here’s what I also know: I know how to tell the truth.  I know right from wrong.  I know how to do this job.  And I know how to get things done.  And I know, like millions of Americans know, when you get kicked down, you get back up.  And we’re back up.  (Applause.),I’ve got a lot more to say, but I’m not going to take a lot of your time.  Let me close with this.  Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this nation.  That is not hyperbole.  He’s a threat to our freedom.  He’s a threat to our democracy.  He is literally a threat to the America that we stand for.,He doesn’t understand what I think all of us do, that America is unique in the world.  We’re literally the unique country in the world.  We’re the only country in the world bas- — built on an idea.  Every other country is built on ethnicity or geography or religion.  Only one based on an idea: We hold these truths to self-evident, that all men and women are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.,We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we’ve — damned if we’ve ever walked away from it.  And I’ll be damned if, in 2024, two years before the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, I’m going to let Donald Trump walk us away from it.  That’s not going to happen.  It’s not going to happen.  (Applause.),You know, I was told by my docs when I had an aneurism years ago — when I was going down to the operating room for a nine-hour operation, I remember asking him — I said, “How am I going to do, doc?”  He said, “Well, you got a good 35 to 50 percent chance.”  (Laughter.)  And I said, “Well, that’s good.”,And after it was all over, he said, “You know what your problem is, Senator?”  He said, “You’re a congenital optimist.”  (Laughter.)  Well, I am.,I still believe this nation is honest and decent, and treating people with respect is important.  I still think this nation gives everyone a fair shot and leaves nobody behind.  I still — I still believe this nation gives hate no safe harbor.  We never have.,And we’re still a beacon to the world.  I can tell you, as my colleagues can, I’ve met every major world leader for the last 207 years.  (Laughter.),But all kidding aside, we can never give up on what America makes America — America makes America — the basic, fundamental truths that we believe in, the decency we have.  The American people are good, decent people.,And Donald Trump is motivated by revenge and retribution.  Well, revenge and retribution never built a damn thing.  But what built America is hope, optimism, a possibility.  (Applause.)  That’s what’s always built America, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do: build America today.,The choice in this election is simple as this: Donald Trump will destroy democracy.  That’s not hyperbole.  He’ll de- — I will defend it.,He’ll never — I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future.  We just have to remember who in the hell we are.  We are the United States of America.  There is nothing — nothing, nothing — beyond our capacity — nothing — when we do it together.  And we plan on doing that.  You’re allowing me to do that.,Folks, thank you very much.  I promise you: We’re going to win this election.  We’re going to win this election.  (Applause.),Thank you, thank you, thank you.  In large part because of you all.  Thank you very much.,Guys, thanks for being here.  Thank you.  (Applause.),And, by the way, I don’t want to go home.  (Laughter.),Thank you, again, our host and hostess.  Tha- — this is magnificent.  (Applause.)  Thank you, thank you, thank you.,All right.  Thanks, everybody.  Enjoy the day.  (Applause.),3:52 P.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",29-06-24,"Remarks by President Biden at a Campaign Reception | East Hampton, NY",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/06/29/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-reception-east-hampton-ny/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,6:50 P.M. EDT,THE PRESIDENT:  Please sit down.  (Applause.)  Please, please.,Phil and Tammy, thank you very much for the hospitality but, more important, for your partnership and friendship.  I — when we ma- — when we picked you to be the ambassador to Germany, we knew we had something good.  When we went over to talk to you into coming back, I was happy for that too.  You’ve got to admit, I can recognize talent.  (Laughter.),And — and, by the way, that Pallone guy, you know, we’ve been hanging — how long, pal?,REPRESENTATIVE PALLONE:  Thirty-six years.,THE PRESIDENT:  Thirty-six years.  He was a kid.,Look, the fact of the matter is you’re incredible leaders in New Jersey and for our nation.,And, Phil, congrats on signing the state budget yesterday.,GOVERNOR MURPHY:  Thank you.,THE PRESIDENT:  I know how hard it is to sign those budgets, to get them to ones you want to sign.  You did it.  And thank you again for everything, both of you.,And, Tammy, you — you’re incredible.  You really are incredible.  The — you know, w- — no, I’m — I’m being serious.  One thing I’ve told the governor from the time we — we actually met one another: We both married way above our station.  (Laughter.),GOVERNOR MURPHY:  That’s true.  That is so true.,THE PRESIDENT:  And so did Frank.  (Laughter.),REPRESENTATIVE PALLONE:  That’s also true.,THE PRESIDENT:  Great to see so many friends and tremendous leaders in the house.,Look, I’d like to make three quick points.,First, thank you all for your support.  No, I really mean it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  You’re making a real difference in building a winning campaign.,You know, in fact, today, we announced, since the debate — which wasn’t my best debate ever, as Barack points out; and he — he had the same thing the first debate — that we’ve raised $27 million — (applause) — $27 million, the strongest stretch since we’ve began this campaign.  And we’ve done very well with fundraising because of all of you.  And, you know, we’re — (laughs) — we’re on track for a very good June.,Secondly, I understand the concern after the debate.  I get it.  I didn’t have a great night.  But I’m going to be fighting harder and going to be — need you with me to get it done.  And here’s what we’re getting reported: Voters had a very different reaction than the pundits did if you look at the polling data.,Since the debate, the polls show little movement and even have me up a couple points since the debate.  (Applause.)  Research during the debate shows us converting more undecided voters than Trump did, in large part because of the — his conduct on January 6th as well as fighting for the working class and — which he doesn’t do.,In fact, the big takeaway are Trump’s lies.  I know the — I know what the Times did today, but they also pointed out he lied 28 times in 90 minutes.  That’s pretty good.  (Laughter.)  But people remember the bad things were — (laughs) — during his presidency, and I guess it reminded them of the past and why they didn’t like him very much.  They don’t like chaos; they don’t like extremism.  And his answers on abortion and January 6th did a lot of damage to him and pointed out what we’re trying to get done.,He also lied about how great he was with veterans.  You know, but then I told how he didn’t have a very good visit to a cemetery — a World War I cemetery outside of Paris that after — I was over there for D-Day, and I spoke at the cemetery — that cemetery as well.  And he said at that cemetery — he wouldn’t go in to honor the veterans because, he said, they were “suckers” and “losers.”  And he tried to deny it.,Let me ask you: Are you going to believe a four-star general — four-star general, his former chief of staff, John Kelly — who said that’s exactly what he said, or a disgraced, defeated, and lying Donald Trump?  (Laughs.)  I don’t think it’s a hard choice.,And how about the fact that 40 of his 44 major — not contributors — staffers and people that worked with him refuse to endorse him?  Forty out of forty-four will not endorse him, including his vice president.  Tells you a lot about a man and a woman in charge.,The point is, I don’t have a — didn’t have a great night but neither did he.  We’ve long believed there are more voters focusing on choice and who’s the better of us than absolute — what happened.,Third, I would not be running again if I didn’t think I had the heart and soul to get this job done.  I know — I know I don’t walk as quickly as I used to, even though I’m only 40.  (Laughter.)  I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to.  I don’t — I don’t debate as well as did las- — in the past.,But let me — here’s what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.  I know right from wrong.  I know how to do this job.  I know how to get things done.  Know, like millions — millions of Americans know, when you get kicked down, you get back up.,Look, let me close with this.  I don’t want to keep you standing.  The fact is that Donald Trump is a genuine threat to the nation.  And that’s not hyperbole.  He’s a genuine threat.  He’s a threat to our freedom.  He’s a threat to our democracy.  And he’s literally a threat to America and what we stand for.,He doesn’t understand what I think most of — all of us do: that America is unique — and this is not hyperbole — America is unique in all the world.  We’re the only nation in the history of mankind that’s been organized based on an idea — an idea.  The idea is that we’re all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, et cetera, and we’re entitled to be treated that our whole lives.,He never fully has lived up to that — we’ve never fully lived it.  But I’ll be damned if, on the year 2024, two years before the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, I’m going to let Donald Trump have us walk away from that.  (Applause.),Look, you know, we’re still a nation — I believe in America.  I’m optimistic.  I really am.,I know, when I had that cranial operation years ago, I was going down — when they were wheeling me down to the operating room, and I asked the doc on — when I was on the s- — the table.  I said, “What are my chances?”  He said, “Oh, they’re pretty good: between 50 and — or 30 and 50 percent.”  And I said, “Well, good.  We’re okay then.”  (Laughter.)  I’m serious.,After it was all over, my neur- — neurosurgeon said to me, “You know what your problem is, Senator?”  I was a senator then.  And I said, “No, what’s that?”  He said, “You’re a congenital optimist.”  (Laughter.),Well, I am about this country.  We’re the only country that’s ever — only country in the history of the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than we went in — every crisis stronger than we went in.  I think our administration is showing that.,We’re the only nation that believes — not the only — but this is a nation that still believes in honesty and decency and treating people with respect.  We’re still a nation that wants to give everyone a fair shot, ju- — just a shot.  My dad used to say, “Just give people a shot.  No guarantee.  A shot.  Give them a oppor- — a fair shot and leave nobody behind.”  We’re still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor.  We’re still a nation that’s the beacon of the world.,Become I’ve been around, as the former ambassador and present governor knows, I know pers- — virtually every world leader, and I’ve known them for a while.  And I’m telling you: We are the envy of the world.  Not me — we, the United States of America.  We are the essential nation.  That’s not hyperbole.  We are the essential nation.,Ask yourself the question: Were it not for America, who would lead the world?  No, I’m not joking.  Who?  What country in the world would be able to do it?  Not a one.,And, look, we can never give up on what makes America, America.,Donald Trump is motivated by repu- — by revenge and retribution.  He wants to — that’s all he talks about.  He never — revenge and retribution never built a damn thing.,Look, we’re a country of hope, optimism, and possibilities.  That’s sounds like — sounds like a — a commercial, but it’s true.  Hope, optimism, and possibility: that’s who we are.  That’s why we attracted so many people.  That’s the way we always build America.  And that’s what we’re going to continue to build today.,You know, the choice this election is as simple as this: Donald Trump, I believe with my ow- — every fiber of my being, will continue to destroy democracy.  Not a joke.  I’ll defend it.,I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future.  We have to remember who in the hell we are.  We’re the United States of America.  There’s not a single thing we can’t do — not a single thing we can’t do if we do it together.  It’s as simple as that.,And we’re going to do it.  And I’ve got a hell of a good set of plans for the next four years, God willing and the crick not rising, as my grandfather would say.  We’re in good shape.  We’re still — and we have the best economy in the world.  But we’ve got to do more for working people.  We’ve got to do more for costs that they have to pay.,My dad used to say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect.  It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, everything is going to be okay.’”  And he meant it.  Well, that’s wh- — there’s still a lot of people who are hurting because of costs — costs.,And if you take a look, you know, we have 15 Nobel laureates in ec- — in economics that just put out a report in the middle of last week.  They predict if Trump gets elected and is able to —,(A child in the audience cries.),THE PRESIDENT:  That’s okay.  We’re used to it.  (Laughter.)  Babies are allowed to cry.  (Laughter.)  You don’t have to take him out.  I’m Catholic; I sit in those churches where they cry all the time.  (Laughter.),But, look, all kidding aside, you know, there is nothing we can’t do.  Not a damn thing we can’t do.  And we just got to give people a shot.  And that’s what we’re doing.,You know, I’ve — trickle-down economics didn- — not a lot trickled down on my dad’s kitchen table.  And so, we decided to build the economy from the middle out, the bottom up because the wealthy still do very well, and everyone gets a shot.  That’s what this is all about.  It really is.,And I think we have a chance to really make — as I said, those economists predicted — you look at the proposal he put out for his budget for next year if he’s elected president.  They predict if he di- — if he were elected and got the budget passed, he would, number one, cause a recession; number two, inflation would go through the roof.  That’s 15 Nobel laureates in e- — economics did that.,They said if I get elected, we’re going to grow the economy, we’re going to have a stable economy, and inflation is going to come down.  So, I think it’s a pretty straightforward choice.  We’ve got to just make sure — you’re allowing me to be in a position to be able to win again to finish the job.,So, thank you, thank you, thank you.  I really — God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.,Thank you.  (Applause.),7:01 P.M.

They show up. They don’t complain. And they only ask for one thing in return: the chance to work hard and build a good life for themselves and their families.,That’s the promise of America. That’s the promise that drew Joe’s and my ancestors to the United States: That we are a nation defined not by language or ethnicity, by race or religion – that America is and has always been defined by us: We, the people.,So, today, I want to tell you an American story.,You came to this country over a decade ago to work, to study, to find a future. You made a plan. And then you fell in love.,So, you built a life – a home. One filled with big smiles on little faces, with laughter and skinned knees, with PTA meetings and soccer practice.,You go to the school of your dreams and start a business and tutor kids in math after school.,And all you want is to give your child all the possibility of the world.,But hanging over you is a shadow: a missing piece of paper – the possibility that your family may not be able to stay together.,It’s a story that too many families all across this country live every day.,Since Joe took office, we’ve heard from those mothers and daughters, those fathers and sons about the agony of that shadow.,So, Joe is doing what he always does – leading the way with compassion and experience – taking the action our nation needs to thrive. Today, Joe is helping our country continue reaching for the dream of America.,With our different backgrounds and beliefs, each of us makes our nation and remakes it – in big ways and small ones. We are millions of individuals that add up to something so much bigger than any one of us.,That’s why what Joe is doing today is for all of us: for the communities that are stronger because of the immigrants who call them home. For the thousands of families who have added their bright and beautiful threads to our American tapestry. For those mothers and husbands and dreamers who have waited so long, worked so hard, given so much.,For people like Javier, who was able to pursue his dream of being a nurse thanks to DACA, who saves lives every day, whose family needs him, and who shouldn’t have to live in fear.,Please help me welcome, Javier Quiroz Castro.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",18-06-24,Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by First Lady Jill Biden at an Event Marking the 12th Anniversary of DACA,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/06/18/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-first-lady-jill-biden-at-an-event-marking-the-12th-anniversary-of-daca/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For generations, they have served in our military, taught in our classrooms, and led our small businesses as entrepreneurs. They are our neighbors, classmates, and loved ones. And their experiences, ambition, and aspirations power our communities, economy, and country each day.,That is why from Day One of our administration, President Joe Biden and I have worked to protect immigrants, keep families together, and expand lawful pathways to citizenship. Working with advocates and organizers from across the nation, we have rejected hateful attacks on immigrants, preserved and fortified DACA, increased access to affordable health care, and expanded economic opportunity.,Today, we are building on that work by taking bold action to bring relief to an estimated half a million spouses of American citizens who have been here in the country for a decade or more and their children. They deserve our protection, and should be allowed to remain with their families and contribute to our communities while they apply for a green card.,President Biden and I are also expediting work visas for Dreamers who have graduated from college in the United States and have a job offer from a U.S. employer. We value their contributions and want them to continue to unleash their skills, ideas, and potential right here in the country that has invested in their success, to the benefit of our economy and our communities.,While today’s actions are a significant step forward, there is more work to be done to fix our broken immigration system. That includes the need for a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers.

EDT,THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you, thank you, thank you.,I think — I think your patience exceeds your good judgment.  (Laughter.),Folks, look, first of all, I want to thank Terry’s neighbors.  Where — where are his neighbors?  (Laughter and applause.)  Because they’ve gone through hell putting this thing on.  (Laughter.)  Understand, the President in your house, everyone — I apologize.  (Laughter.)  But thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, we’ll — we’ll figure it out.,Terry, thanks for hosting us and thanks for your friendship.  I remember being here back in 2020 when a lot of people believed we couldn’t win.  And — but Terry and his family believed we could then and now.  (Applause.),Most of all, thanks to President and Secretary Clinton, who we all know as Bill and Hillary.  They’re dear friends, great Americans, and I’m grateful — I’m truly grateful for their support.,You know, Bill holds the record for the most jobs created.  And I’m hoping, in another four years, I can get close.  (Applause.),Hillary, you were not only a great senator and Secretary of State, you’re a hell of a producer.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  And to see you on a — the reception you got at the Tony Awards — holy God almighty — (applause) — standing ovation speaking to the power of women.,Folks, back in 2016, Hillary warned us about many things, including how the Supreme Court was at stake and the rights of women were at stake.  She was right.,Over the weekend, in Los Angeles, Barack and I made the point: The next president could have possibly two or more Supreme Court justices in the next four years.  That would mean, if Trump wins, there would be five or more MAGA-r- — -appointed justices that could determine the future for decades to come.,AUDIENCE:  Boo —,THE PRESIDENT:  We can’t let that happen.  (Applause.),I said in 2020, we’re in a battle for the soul of America.  And here we are in 2024, and what we’re fighting for is clear.  It’s freedom — in the literal sense — freedom, democracy, America.,Because all of you in this room and all of you in this tent and supporters around the country, look how far we’ve come.  We came through a pandemic, as it was mentioned; we have the strongest economy in the world right now; 15 million new jobs — a record in three and a half years — (applause); historic unemployment, including Black and Hispanic unemployment; historic small-business creation; historic economic growth and wages continue to rise; the most significant investment in climate ever — ever in the history of the world — (applause); and a record in building Ameri- — rebuilding America’s roads, bridges, high-speed rail, ports, airports, clean water system, affordable high-speed Internet — the list goes on.,Remember Trump had — every year he had — every month he had — you know, month — the — the month was devoted to this issue.  Well, we got 10 years’ worth, and we’re just starting.  (Applause.),Folks, in the second term, we can do much more to create more good-paying jobs; make housing more affordable; lower inflation, which is down sig- — significantly, by taking on corporate greed — to fundamentally clear — change the economy and grow from the middle out — that was what we talked about.  I remember talking about this with you, Hillary, back when you were in the Senate.  The trickle-down economic system didn’t work a whole lot.,My dad used to say not a whole lot trickled down to his kitchen table.  (Laughter.)  But when th- — no, I’m serious.  My dad was a — was a well-read man who has a — a heart of gold.  And he used to — we talk about — what we decided to do was build from the middle out and the bottom up.  That way the w- — the wealthy still do very well and the poor have a chance and the middle class continue to grow.,But Trump will redu- — (applause) — because — and I mean this sincerely — because Terry is such a — did such a good job talking about these issues, all I’m going to say is Trump has made it clear: If he wins, he’s going to undo everything we’ve done.,Folks, for the first time in American history, a former President that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency.  But as disturbing as that is, more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on our system of justice — literally a — an all-out assault that is being supported by the Republican Party — not because he was convicted but the way he tries to undermine the system.,Folks, it’s clearer every day: The threat Trump poses would be greater in a second term than it was in his first term.  You know, he snapped when he lost in — I mean this sincerely — I think he snapped when he lost in 2020.  He can’t accept he lost.  He’s — literally driving him crazy.  That’s why on January 6th happened.  He’s — now he’s running again.  He’s not only obsessed with losing in 2020, he’s clearly a little bit unhinged right now.  No, I’m being serious.,Just listen to him.  He says he wants to — he wants, in his words, to be dictator on “day one.”  He says he wants his words — in his words, to “terminate” the Constitution.  He calls convicted insurrectionists who are in prison “patriots,” and he says, if reelected, he’s going to pardon every one of them.  Trump says if he loses again in November — using his words — there will be a “bloodbath” — his phrase — there will be a “bloodbath.”,Throughout this campaign, Trump has made it clear he is running to exact revenge.  And now, after criminal convictions, it’s clear he’s worried about preserving his freedoms.,While Trump is worried about preserving his freedoms, he’s got a lot of problems.  He’s taking away — you know, look, he’s taking away your freedom.  But he’s got three or four other cases to m- — that could put him in jail.,Folks, Trump brags about he’s the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned.  Well, guess what?  Kamala and I are going to be the reason why Roe v. Wade is returned.  (Applause.),More children are killed in America by guns — more children are killed in America by guns than any other cause.  But Trump has got no problem taking away the freedom of children who just want to go to school.,Did you ever think — those of you who are over the age of 50 — we’d be talking about “duck and cover” in school for our children?,Without gun violence — look, he told the NRA he was proud of — in his words, he did, quote, “nothing on guns when I was president.”  He’s going to undo everything we’ve done since I’ve been elected, including the most significant gun safety provision in 30 years, since President Clinton signed the assault weapons ban.  (Applause.),But, folks, I’ll try to make this — that’s not all.  We pay more for prescription drugs than any advanced nation in the world.  From the time we were in the Senate together, Hillary and I fought to take on Big Pharma.  I’ve been fighting that fight for over 35 years.  We finally beat Big Pharma, giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices — (applause) — just — just like the VA does — negotiates lower drug prices.,And guess what?  Now seniors with diabetes pay only $35 a month instead of $400 a month for their insulin.  (Applause.)  Starting next year, there will be a cap.  Seniors, no matter how many prescription drugs they have, including whether they have the cost of those cancer drugs that can be 12-, 14-, 15,000 bucks a year — the cap is $2,000 — all they’ll have to pay, no matter how many drugs.  (Applause.),Folks, these reforms not only save people’s lives and money, it saves the American taxpayer $160 billion — (applause) — is being saved because Medicare no longer has to pay these exorbitant prices.  But Trump wants to undo that law and give power back to Big Pharma to rip the American people and charge whatever they want for the medicines they need badly.  It’s outrageous.,In a second term, he’s going to make it available — make it avail- — I — my second term, we’re going to make it available to all Americans.  Because when I first got this law passed in the beginning of the year, it applied to every American, not just seniors.  And the Republicans blocked it the second time around.  We’re going to make sure every American pays a fair price, not an exorbitant price.,And, of course, he still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that provides millions of Americans with preexisting conditions who have no other alternative to get healthcare the ability to get it.  Trump wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, but I’m not only going to protect it, I’m expanding it.  (Applause.),When Trump got elected in 2016, he told everyone he didn’t need their money.  Remember he said, “I don’t need the money.”  Not only did he lie then, he’s lying now.  (Laughter.)  He’s desperate.  He’s out selling Bibles and gold sneakers.  (Laughter.),What’s more trouble, he’s selling out his presidency to the highest bidder at Mar- — down at Mar-a-Lago.  (Applause.)  He told the oil executives he met down there — he said: If you give — if you give me a — raise a mil- — billion dollars for me in campaign contributions — his words — we have “a deal” because taxes and regulations he would help them avoid.  He said, “drill, drill, drill.”  That’s his promise.,He increased the national debt by $8 trillion, and he made — talks about managing the budget — this guy talks about it?  Come on.  He’s the only the president other than Herbert Hoover who lost more jobs by the time he left office than when he entered office.,But that’s not all.  Former Secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton, Larry Summers, wrote, “If you’re worried about inflation, Trump is just going to make it a hell of a lot worse.”  And he would.,Everything Trump is proposing, from new taxes for the — for super wealthy, the biggest to- — tax cuts — corporations are going to expand the federal debt to a huge new consumer tax in front of a giant 10 percent tariffs on every product — that’s what he says he wants to do — every product coming to America, he wants a 10 percent tariff on it.  That’s going to drive up inflation.,And he’s reported to have said behind closed doors, according to the press, he — he’ll replace the income tax system — eliminate it and make it all tariffs.  A study came out today that shows his plan would increase taxes on the average middle-class family by $8,300 a year.,Folks, I have a different plan.  There are a hundred billionaires in America — a thou- — I mean, a thousand in America.  They pay an average federal tax rate of 8.3 percent.  But I — anybody want to trade places with them?  (Laughter.)  That’s less than a firefighter, a teacher, a nurse — and I could go on.,But if we just raise the minimum billionaire tax to 25 percent, it would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years.  (Applause.)  Imagine what we could do to help provide childcare, eldercare, paid leave; reduce the federal deficit; and generate economic growth.,Look, folks, let me close with this.  Virginia is a proud veterans state.  (Applause.)  Earlier this month, I was in Normandy, France, visiting the site of the D-Day invasion — one of the most important moments in history in the defense of freedom and democracy.  I also visited an American cemetery that Trump refused to visit because he thought the veterans buried there were “suckers” and “losers” — his phrase.  My God.,I got to tell you, I’m glad I wasn’t there.  I mean it.  My son died because of what happened in Iraq.  The idea this sucker calls a — I’m not going to s- — look, what those soldiers died for, must we never give up.,I want to say it as clearly as I can: Democracy is on the ballot this year.  The future of democracy and freedom is at stake.  These brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy and other places in the — that invasion did their part.  Now we got to do ours.,I know we can do this together.  I’ve never been more optimistic about our future.  We just have — I’ll shorten this — I’ll end this now.  We just have to remember who in the hell we are.  We’re the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There is nothing beyond our capacity — nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.  (Applause.),God bless you all.  And I hope to hell there’s still a dinner for you all.  (Applause.),Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  (Applause.),END   7:43 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Today, Director of the Gender Policy Council Jennifer Klein, Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden, and Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian, alongside Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Vice Chair Jocelyn Samuels, Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda, and Department of Commerce CHIPS Program Office Director Michael Schmidt, met with semiconductor manufacturers, construction contractors, labor unions, tradeswomen groups, and advocates to discuss best practices that will expand the construction workforce by creating pathways for women and other underrepresented groups, as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda.,Women currently represent less than 11 percent of workers in the construction industry, and less than 5 percent of workers in skilled construction trades occupations. Growing the share of women and other underrepresented groups in construction is critical to delivering President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, which is creating millions of good-paying jobs and union jobs in infrastructure, semiconductors, and clean energy.,Participants in the roundtable discussed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to increasing inclusion of women and underrepresented communities in the construction industry; heard from union leaders and tradeswomen about successful strategies to recruit, train, and retain women; and highlighted the following new announcements:,These announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to reduce barriers and increase access for women and underrepresented communities in the construction trades, including: the Department of Commerce’s novel requirement that certain CHIPS and Science Act funding recipients ensure access to affordable, reliable, high-quality child care for their workers with young children; the Department of Labor’s toolkit on,Building an Equitable Infrastructure Workforce: Gender Equity Strategies as a Model,, including strategies, resources, and examples for building a diverse workforce, conducting targeted recruitment and addressing barriers to entry, and retaining a diverse workforce; and the Department of Transportation’s report on,Investing in America: Best Practices to Expand Access to Jobs and Economic Opportunity Through Transportation Infrastructure Investments,, detailing barriers for underrepresented populations, including women, to access construction jobs and recommendations for enhancing diversity in the construction workforce.,Participants included representatives from companies that have signed onto the CHIPS Women in Construction Framework (Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, GlobalFoundries, and Polar Semiconductor); companies that have signed onto the Million Women in Construction Community Pledge (Mortenson, Bechtel, Turner Construction); as well as labor union and advocate partners from North America’s Building Trades Unions, TradesFutures, International Union of Painters and Allied Trade, United Association, and Equal Rights Advocates.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",18-06-24,Readout of White House Roundtable on Best Practices to Increase Women in Construction,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/18/readout-of-white-house-roundtable-on-best-practices-to-increase-women-in-construction/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,East Room,3:23 P.M. EDT,THE PRESIDENT: Javier, thank you. (Applause.),Please, sit down.,Today is a good day. (Applause.),The first bill I introduced when I was president — an immigration bill that included this provision, but it never got off the ground. It needed a little more help. But now, today, a significant portion of it is being passed — or being — by executive order.,Javier, thank you for that introduction and for sharing your family’s story.,You know, I’ve often said doctors — we’ve been a significant consumer of healthcare in my family. Spent a lot of time in hospitals in — for our family. My — anyway. And I always said that doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. Not a joke. A lot of time in ICU, a lot of time with my son, a lot of time —,And, you know, it’s a — if there’s any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses — men and women. Not a joke.,So, thank you for what you did to help us get through the pandemic, pal, and for all you’re doing for our country. (Applause.),My name is Joe Biden. I’m Jill Biden’s husband. (Laughter and applause.),And thanks to all the members of the Congress and Homeland Security Secretary — I (inaudible) — I’m not sure I’m going to introduce you all the way — (laughter) — but all kidding aside, Secretary Mayorkas, as well as Secretary Becerra and advocates and families for law enforcement, faith leaders, everybody who is here.,Two weeks ago, I did what Republicans in Congress refused to do: I took action to secure our border. That included restricting unlawful crossings at our southern border, making decisions on asylum more quickly, and so much more. And so far, it’s working.,Since we implemented my order, encounters have dropped 25 percent at the border. And we’re seeing the lowest number we’ve seen in a long time. (Applause.),Bu- — but, folks, I took this step after the bipartisan agreement one of the most conservative Republican senators had helped work through in over a four- or five-week period — the strongest bipartisan security agreement that’s ever been seen — but we were about to move forward when Republicans walked away from the deal in the most pathetic and petty of reasons: Donald Trump got on the phone, literally, and started — and the press can confirm this — and calling them — calling senators, saying, “Don’t. Don’t go ahead and do this. Don’t support this legislation that had bipartisan support.”,And wh- — he asked — when you ask why, he said it wouldn’t — it would hurt him politically and help me instead. So much for Republicans caring about the border.,I also know many people in this room also had concerns about the steps I had taken. I heard and respected from many of you and many people behind me of the concerns you felt. As president, I had to take these actions. Every nation must secure its border. It’s just that simple. And if Trump and the Republicans wouldn’t do it working with me, then I would do it on my own. And I did.,At the time I took these steps to secure the border, I also said that I would move to fix problems that made our immigration system unfair, unjust, and provisions that simply made it — no sense at all, specifically, steps that will be good for DREAMers, married couples, and for Americans. That’s why we’re here today.,A few days ago, we marked the 12th anniversary of taking care of DREAMers as — that President Obama and I put in place. There are few of these immigrant — of these immigration areas that have had most positive area — impact and gotten more support from the American people across the board.,These young people known as DREAMers — Hispanic, South Asians, and more — who came to America as children, only know America as their home, have been able to live and learn out of the shadow- — out of the shadows. So many of them have graduated from high school and college and are starting families on their own, building successful careers, serving our nation in uniform, and so, so much more.,We’re a much better and stronger nation because of DREAMers, like Javier, who just introduced me.,So, today, I’m announcing new measures to clarify and speed up work visas to help people, including DREAMers, who have graduated from U.S. colleges and universities, landed jobs in high-demand, high-skilled professions that we need to have grow — see our economy grow. It’s the right thing to do. (Applause.),I want those who have been educated at U.S. college and universities to put their skills and knowledge to work for — here in America. I want to keep building the strongest economy in the world with the best workforce in the world.,We’ve already created 15 million new jobs — a record. We’re seeing record economic growth, a record small-business growth.,And I doubt why the action we’re taking today matters — if you wonder about that, just ask business leaders, ask labor leaders, ask economists, ask elected officials. They know it’s good for American business. They know it’s good for the American economy. They know it’s good for America, period.,This step builds on other actions we’ve taken to support DREAMers, from defending DREAMers in the courts and expressing — expanding access to healthcare for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act, including for DREAMers. (Applause.),The second action I’m announcing today, which — or is about keeping families together — my dad used to have an expression; he’d say, “Joey, family is about the beginning, middle, and the end” — about keeping couples together who are married, where one spouse is a U.S. citizen, the other is undocumented, and they’ve been living in the United States for at least 10 years.,These couples have been raising families, sending their kids to church and school, paying taxes, contributing to our country for every — for 10 years or more — matter of fact, the average time they’ve spent here is 23 years, the people we’re affecting today — but living in the United States all this time with a fear and uncertainty.,We can fix that, and that’s what I’m going to do today: fix it. (Applause.),And here’s the point: It doesn’t require any fundamental change in our immigration law. There’s already a system in place for people we’re talking about today, but the process is cumbersome, risky, and it separates families.,Under the current process, undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens must go back to their home country — for example, to Mexico, for example — to fill out paperwork and obtain long-term legal status. They have to leave their families in America with no assurance that they’ll be allowed back into the United States, so they stay in America but in the shadows, living in constant fear of deportation without the ability to legally work. All this even though, under the law today, they are eligible for long-term legal status.,Today, I’m announcing a commonsense fix to streamline the process for obtaining legal status for immigrants married — excuse me — to American citizens who live — live here and lived here for a long time. For those wives or husbands and their children who have lived in America for a decade or more but are undocumented, this action will allow them to file the paperwork for legal status in the United States, allow them to work while they remain with their families in the United States.,And let’s be clear: This action still requires undocumented spouses to file all required legal paperwork to remain in the United States. It requires them to pass a criminal background check. And it doesn’t apply to anyone trying to come here today. It only applies — t- —,This action is a better way. It doesn’t tear families apart, while requiring every undocumented spouse to fulfill their obligations under the law.,Look, the actions I’m announcing today will go into effect later this summer.,And by the way, just as was true for the protection of DREAMers, the steps I’m taking today are overwhelmingly supported by the American people, no matter what the other team says. In fact, polls show over 70 percent of Americans support this effort to keep families together. (Applause.),It’s important. And the reason is simple: It embraces the American principle that we should be — keep families together.,In 2013, President Obama and I took a similar action that allowed undocumented spouses and children of American servicemen to stay together while they apply for legal status in America. Servicemen protecting our nation should not have to worry about keeping their families together, for God’s sake. This policy has been in place for over a decade, and it’s working well, and so will the new one.,Look, let me close with this. I refuse to believe that to secure our border we have to walk away from being an America for that’s — generations have been renewed, revitalized, and refreshed by the talent, the skill, the hard work, the courage, and determination of immig- — immigrants coming to our country.,Look, the Statue of Liberty is not some relic of American history. It stands — still stands for who we are.,But I also refuse to believe that for us to continue to be America that embraces immigration, we have to give up securing our border. They’re false choices. We can both secure the border and provide legal pathways to citizenship.,But we have to acknowledge that the patience and goodwill of the American people is being tested by their fears at the border. They don’t understand a lot of it. These are the fears my predecessor is trying to play on when he says immigrants — immigrants, in his words, are “poisoning the blood of the country”; when he calls immigrants, in his words, “animals.”,When he was president, he separated families and children at the border. And now he’s proposing to rip spouses and children from their families and homes and communities and place them in detention camps. He’s actually saying these things. It’s hard to believe it’s being said, but he’s actually saying these things out loud. And it’s outrageous.,Folks, I’m not interested in playing politics with the border or immigration. I’m interested in fixing it.,I’ve said it before — (applause) — I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again today: I will work with anyone to solve these problems. That’s my responsibility as president. That’s our responsibility as Americans. Because the simple truth is there’s not a single damn thing we can’t do if we put our minds to it.,We got to remember who in the hell we are. We’re the United States of America, and nothing is beyond our capacity. (Applause.) We’re a nation of immigrants, and that’s who we are.,God bless you all. And may God protect our forces.,Thank you.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,James S. Brady Press Briefing Room,1:52 P.M. EDT,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Good afternoon, everyone.,Q Good afternoon.,Q Hello.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Hello. Weijia, hello.,Okay, I have a couple things at the top, and then we’ll get going.,So, as you all know, this afternoon, President Biden and the First Lady will host an event to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the Def- — Deferred — of the Deferred Action for Child- — Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA.,Over the last 12 years, DACA has provided more than 800,000 DREAMers with the ability to work lawfully, pursue an education, open businesses, and contribute their enormous talents to make our communities better and stronger.,While Congress has failed to act on the reforms President Biden pres- — presented on the first day of his presidency, the Biden-Harris administration vigorously defended DACA in court and extended Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients.,Now, later today, not to — in a couple of — not to — less than an hour — today, President Biden will announce that the Department of Homeland Security will take action designed to help U.S. citizens with noncitizens spouses keep their families together.,This new process will help certain noncitizen spouses and children apply for lawful permanent residency — a status they are already eligible for — without having to leave the country.,Additionally, President Biden will announce that the administration will facilitate the employment visa process for those who have graduated from college and have a high-skilled job offer, including DACA recipients and other DREAMers.,Think about the stability this will bring to so many American families across the country. These measures will help keep American families together and allow more young people to contribute to our economy and our country.,The Biden-Harris administration is committed to taking action, within its authorities, to secure our border and ensure that our immigration system is more fair and more just.,As you all remember, two weeks ago, President Biden announced additional actions to secure our southern border after Congressional Republicans twice — twice — voted against the toughest and fairest set of reforms in decades.,And while we are still in the early phase of implementation, encounters in between ports of entry are down and repat- — repatriations are up.,However, we know that only Congress can deliver the additional personnel, resources, and policy changes needed to secure our border. And only Congress can deliver the comprehensive reform of our immigration and asylum laws that is needed to secure our border and make our immigration system work.,We’ll continue to call on lawmakers to do just that.,Next, I also wanted to quickly address the extreme heat wave that we are seeing across the country.,We know that extreme heat can be dangerous, which is — which is especially true for older adults and people with under- — under- — underlying health conditions.,We encourage everyone experiencing extreme temperatures this week to check in on their neighbors, drink plenty of water, and look for cooling centers if needed.,Stay alert, listen to local officials and weather alerts, and visit Heat.gov for more information on how to stay safe.,And finally, this week, Thursday, June 27th, our administration will amplify the President’s and Vice President’s work to lower cost for hardworking Americans. The Cabinet and senior White House officials will travel across the country to discuss the Biden-Harris lowering costs agenda.,From healthcare and housing to gas prices and groceries, we will lay out the full scope of the Biden-Harris lowering costs agenda and new products and speeches, and make clear that congressional Republicans are putting the wealthy and the big corporations first with an agenda to raise costs for har- — hardworking families.,You all should have a full list of events through next Thursday in your inbox. And I know you all will look forward to — to the — to those events across the country.,With that, Jeremy, it has been a long time.,Q Jeremy?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Jeremy — Josh.,Q It has been a long time. (Laughter.) Too long.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: It has been too long. I forgot your name. (Laughter.),Q It’s okay. Two s- —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No. No, you know I love you, Josh. It has indeed been a long time. I was thinking about my Jeremy in,the back. So, as I was — anyway, whatever.,Q I’ll take it.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Things — things are happening. It’s good to see you.,Q Thing- — with busy times.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: It’s good to see.,Q Good to you see. Two subjects.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.,Q First, on immigration today. Is the administration confident that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services can handle possibly hundreds of thousands of new applications given the current backlog of other immigration applications?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we have always said — and I — I said this at the top — like, the way that we would love to move forward is in a more balance — a balanced approach, obviously, and — and get that bipartisanship from Congress.,The first day of his administration — as I’ve already stated, and I’ve stated this many times — we wanted to see a compre- — comprehensive immigration process, a legislation. That’s what the President put forward. He wanted to see that. Congress never moved.,And when they did decide to move on something — we worked in a bipartisan way — the former President told Republicans in Congress — Republican senators, more specifically — and told them, “Don’t move on this. Don’t move on this because it’s going to hurt me and help Joe Biden.” And we had a bipartisan approach, which would have made the immigration system more fair and tougher. And we didn’t move in that way.,And so, the President has said that he’s going to take actions. He’s going to take actions to secure the border, as he did with the executive order that he signed just about two — two weeks ago or so. And that he also wants to make sure we keep American families together.,So, look, we’re obviously going to hear from the — from the President later today. And we believe that we can get this done. We believe it’s an important part of the President’s, you know, immigration policy. And keeping Amer- — American families together, making sure that we are protecting American families is a priority for this President.,And so, we believe that this could move forward.,Q Gotcha. Secondly, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said he told Secretary of State Blinken, quote, “It’s inconceivable that, in the past few months, the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunition for Israel,” end quote. There was a shipment of bombs paused in early May at the start of the Rafah offensive. But has the administration been withholding weapons and ammunitions for months, like Netanyahu seems to be saying?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, let me just start off by saying that we genuinely do not know what he’s talking about. We just don’t.,A couple of things that I do want to add. And you’re right, there was one particular shipment of munitions that was paused, and you’ve heard us talk about that many times. We continue — we continue to have these constructive conv- — discussions with Is- — Israelis for the release of that particular shipment that I just mentioned, and don’t have any updates on that.,There are no other pauses — none — no other pauses or holds in place. And so, as Secretary Blinken said today, he held — he took some questions from some of your colleagues and — and took — and talked — spoke to the press, obviously — everything else is moving in due process. That is coming from Secretary Blinken. You heard directly from him earlier today.,Q Thanks.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Selina.,Q Thanks, Karine. So, just to confirm —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — only the shipment of those 2,000-pound bombs have been withheld?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.,Q Got it.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: That’s to confirm, and yes.,Q And when it comes to the new executive actions today on immigration, can you just talk us through why now? Why not earlier?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, and I — and I said this a little bit, and I’ll say it again, which is — and we say this: Our immigration system is broken. It has been for some decades.,The President wants to — to have a comprehensive legislative fix. That’s the process that we actually want to take. And that’s why he did on day one.,And so, look, we want to see a balanced approach. We want to see a bipartisan movement on this.,But Congress has failed to act. They just have. They voted twice on a — on a proposal legislation that they, Republicans and Democrats, came together on to move forward on dealing with what’s happening, the challenges at the border, what’s happening with immigration. Republicans rejected it. They rejected it twice.,And so, announcing these actions to keep families together — you know, we’re talking about American citizens and their families — to keep them together. We’re talking about young people who contribute — they are contributing to the economy. They are contributing to the — to their communities. We want to make sure we keep that talent here.,And so, that is why we’re taking this action. We can do both. We can secure the border, as we did with announcing the executive order, and we can also protect American families. And that’s what the President is going to be — going to be doing — announcing today.,Q And can you just walk us through how the administration decided the contours of this. For instance, it is 10 years, but if someone’s been married for — it’s — you have to be in the country for at least 10 years, but if you’ve —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, at least a decade.,Q — been in the country for just slightly less than that, they would not eventually be eligible. Right?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, yeah, that is correct. Anybody who has — and the — the other added piece of this is anybody who is pres- — wanting — presenting themselves today would not be — would not be eligible as well. And it is a decade. You have to have — be here for at least a decade to be able to be — obviously, to — to take part of this announcement that the President is making.,And — and here’s the thing. The average — the average person who would be eligible for this, we — we are predicting, have been here for about 23 years — 23 years.,Q Just — but what do you say —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — to those families, you know, who have a member who’s been here for, like, 9 years and 11 months?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, I hear you. I —,Q And so, they’ll never —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I hear you.,Q Will they have a chance, eventually?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, the way to actually deal with this is to have a comprehensive immigration legislation, is for Congress to do their jobs and to move forward. And what we have seen is Republicans getting in the way because of what the last President said. And that is the way that we want to see this moving.,We have said — I have said this many times — we want to move — we wanted to move in a balanced approach — a balanced approach. And that’s how we had se- — had seen this process that’s going to be part of this announcement, obviously.,And — but, you know, Congress, it ha- — they have to fix this. In order to actually fix this broken immigration system, Congress has to act. And, you know, we are going to do everything that we can to move forward in a way where we are obviously protecting American families and also dealing with the challenges at the border, trying to fix a broken immigration — or deal with a broken immigration system that’s been broken for decades.,And, you know, this is one process that — one announcement that we’re moving forward with. And, you know, there’s — you know, and the President is always going to look for other ways to deal with this broken immigration system, but honestly, Congress has to act. They have to act.,Go ahead, Weijia.,Q Thanks, Karine. Do you have any details about the timeframe and when people can actually start applying for this program?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, don’t have anything to share on the actual timeline on this. We want to make sure, again, that our border is secure. We want to make sure that we’re — we are — we — you know, we want to make sure that it’s an immigration system that is more fair, more just.,Don’t have anything on the timeline. I’m — I’m sure DHS may have more on that specific question that you have.,Q And then just following up on Selina.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q Given the amount of time it’s going to take to process the applications, given the fact that it could all be undone if there’s a new administration, am I hearing the reason why the President didn’t do this sooner is because he thought Congress would do it?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, here —,Q Is that why?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: What I’m saying is that, as you know, we worked really hard to protect DACA. We put out a comprehensive immigration system. DACA was part of that. Fixing what’s happening and securing the border, obviously, was part of that. Fixing a — an immigration policy that’s been broken for decades, obviously, was par- — part of that. That’s why it was comprehensive.,The President has been focused on this since day one and worked with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to try to figure out how do we move forward with a policy that’s fair and just. And we believe it is still the way to go — is to do this through Congress, to do this in a legislative way.,And so, the President is always going to — look, and you hear us say this often — the President is going to look for different ways to move forward on dealing with this broken system that we have. We’re always going to find ways.,We — two weeks ago, we made an announcement on — and — and he signed an EO on securing the border. We did that. But we’ve taken more act- — more actions than that before go- — leading up to that EO.,And today we’re making this announcement on protecting American families.,So, look, we would rather see Congress act — that’s what we want to see — and do it in a comprehensive way. They should, you know, take a look at — at the legislation that we put forward on day one or go back to their bipartisan proposal that they put forward.,So, there are ways to do this. And the President said he will always look at different options, and this is — this is one of them.,Q How you respond to Republicans who say —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — this particular move is just an election-year stunt?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I’m not here to talk about election year. That’s not what I’m here to talk about.,I’m here to talk about the President’s policy and why he’s doing this, because we have a broken immigration system.,The President did this on his first day when he put forth that comprehensive immigration system.,For about two months or so — coming out of last year, going into early this year — the President worked his team — he directed his team to work with Congress on getting — getting done a bipartisan, you know, proposal to deal with immigration. And we were able to do that. We were able to do that with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, and Republicans rejected it. They rejected it because of what they were told by the former President.,That’s politics. That’s putting partisan first, right? That’s partisanship. That’s politics. That is doing something on behalf of someone who is currently a candidate for 2024.,We have been saying since day one we want to figure out how to fix this broken system.,Go ahead, J.J.,Q On the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office just came out with its new numbers. It’s saying that the U.S. budget deficit will be — will reach $1.92 trillion in 2024, up from $1.69 trillion in 2023. Anything you can share in reaction?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you just sta- — stated to me, J.J., it just came out. So, obviously, I don’t have — I haven’t seen it yet and need to talk to our folks.,A couple of things I do want to say is that this President has a strong agenda and — to reduce the deficit. You hear him talk about this very often, instead of blowing it up again by extending the Trump tax cuts, which would cost $5 trillion — $5 trillion — while the last administration increased the debt by a record $8 trillion and didn’t sign a single law to reduce the — the deficit.,And what we have done, what this President has done: He has signed legislation to reduce the deficit by $1 trillion since taking office. That’s what he’s been able to do.,So, moreover, this budget would lower the deficit another $3 trillion by making the wealth and large corporation pay their fair share; closing tac- — tack loophol- — tax loopholes; cutting wasteful spending on Big Pharma, Big Oil, and other special interests.,And it is the opposite of what congressional Republicans are trying to do when they are trying to give tax cuts to billionaires and corporation, which will hurt the middle class, which will hurt the working class.,And so, that is not what the President wants to do. We cannot afford that. And so, the President is going to continue to work to do everything that he can to do the right thing when it comes to lowering the deficit.,Again, I haven’t seen this report, so I can’t say much. But I can speak to what the President has tried to do more broadly.,Go ahead.,Q Thanks, Karine. A question about President — Russian President Putin’s visit to North Korea and his words today about supporting North Korea against the “enemy,” which he identified as the United States. What’s the White House’s response to that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q And to what extent are you concerned — or are more concerned now after what he said about what Russia would like to do?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, just a couple of things. I — I know that he is in the DPRK today, and then he’s going to go to Hanoi in the nex- — in the upcoming weeks.,My colleague from — my NSC colleague spoke to this just a little bit yesterday. So, you know, deepening cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a trend that should be of great concern to anyone interested in main- — in maintaining peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, upholding the global nonproliferat- — -proliferation regime, abiding by the U.N. Security Council resolutions, and supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their — for their freedom and their independence against Russian’s aggression and their — obviously, Russia’s invasion.,This is something we have been warning about for some time, as DPRK’s provision of weapons to Russia has helped enable Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine.,So, we noted that Putin and Xi joint statement last month called for all sides to reaffirm that political and diplomatic means as they — as the only way to resolve issues on the Korean Peninsula. We hope this is a message that Putin will convey to Kim in their discussion.,As we have said before, we don’t believe any country should give Mr. Putin a platform to — to promote the war of aggression that we’re obviously cle- — currently seeing in Ukraine. And Russia, we believe, is blatantly violating the U.N. Charter and working to undermine the internat- — international system.,And so, you know, this is — this is something, obviously, that we’re watching very closely, and we continue to do so.,Q And what about going — flowing the other way? What concerns does the White House have about support that Russia may provide to North Korea?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, that — that is obviously something that we are concerned with as well. It’s — it goes both — both sides, both ways, obviously, with — with Putin. We are seeing — we are seeing this invasion in Ukraine. And so, any — any collaboration in helping Putin do this — Mr. Putin do this is something that we are, again, deeply, deeply concerned about.,Q One follow-up, lastly, on the question of timing for the immigration move today.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q Can you just give us a sense of —,Q We have an emergency.,Q Yeah, I’m sorry.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, hold on. Did somebody pass out?,Q Yes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. Can we get —,Q Yeah.,(Press briefing pauses.),(Press briefing resumes.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. Sorry about that. Hopefully, she’s okay.,Q It is stuffy in here. We could use some —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You are —,Q Some sort of air.,Q (Inaudible) heat effect right there.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, yeah. You are correct. It is — it is hot in here.,Q I was just asking a follow-up question. If we’re —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.,Q — if we’re all okay.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think we’re okay. I think we’re okay to move on.,Q Okay.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And does anybody need water?,We’re good? Do you want —,Q Scotch, perhaps. (Laughter.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. That’s a whole another place. Not here.,Q It used to be standard, I think, in this (inaudible).,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh — oh, really? Okay.,Okay. Go ahead. I’m sorry.,Q No, not at all. Thanks for helping.,With regard to the timing of — (medical staff enters press briefing room) — of the President’s decision today.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh. Oh, wait. Hold on one second.,Q Yeah.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Hold on.,Okay. Timing —,Q Yes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: — on immigration.,Q Could you just give us a sense —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: The announcement.,Q Yes, exactly. Could you just give us a sense of the discussions that led to doing this? Did —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q Did — whose idea was it?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q Why now? I mean —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — you’ve already answered why now, but —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — just the — how did it come to this?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I — look, I — I certainly am not going to speak to private discussions that are — are had at the White House. What I can speak to and very much how I answered the question moments ago: Look, the President has always said he wants to do everything that he can to deal with this broken immigration system, this — and immigration policies as well.,You heard us talk about DACA. That’s something that happened back in 2012 when it was Obama-Biden administration and how we — from the beginning of this administration, we’ve tried to protect and fight for DACA, and we continue to do so. Right?,So, there is — there is a history, if you will, about the President wanting to protect American families, wanting to pro- — protect, you know, American citizens, and this is what you see in this announcement, and — and, you know, making sure that, you know, people who have been here — I said, on the average, there’s some folks who’ve been here for 23 years — 23 years. And, you know, when you — separating them is kind of a cruel thing to do. Right?,And these are people who have — who have contributed to our economy, contributed to communities across the country. And this is very different than what we saw from the last administration. The last administration literally separated families — babies from their parents, from their fathers, from their mothers — and it was cruel. We are — in this administration, we are working to get those families reunited.,And so, we want to make sure that we’re securing the border. We want to make sure that we’re doing everything that we can to do that. And we also want to make sure that we have a fair and just system, and that is something that the President continues to — to live by. And that’s what this announcement is all about today.,Go ahead, M.J.,Q Thanks, Karine. Can you offer an updated readout of Amos Hochstein’s talks in Beirut?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q And what is the President’s level of concern about there being a serious escalation that erupts between Israel and Lebanon, or does he think we’re already there, you know, at this point?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. So, a couple of things on that. As you know, he is — he’s — Amis is — Amos. Amos. I’m having problems with names today. Amos is in Lebanon today. And — and so, it is important discussions that he is having. And part of those discussions, obviously, is restoring calm along the Blue Line, which remains a top priority for the United States and must be the utmost importance for both Lebanon and Israel. And that’s what you’re seeing, obviously, Amos take part of while he’s in the region.,We have been concerned by the increase in violence, to your question, M.J., including the firing of more than 200 rockets by Hezbollah at Israel this past week. And so, we are going to continue to work hard toward a diplomatic resolution that would allow Israel and Leb- — Lebanese citizens to return to their homes and live in peace and security.,And so, though — that conversation about the Blue Line, obviously, remains a priority — a top priority for us. I don’t have any readout. I know Amos had an opportunity to talk to the press earlier today while he was in Lebanon, but I just don’t have anything beyond that.,Q Does he, the President, think the recent events amount to a serious escalation in this situation?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, the President — this — what you’re seeing is the President’s efforts to avoid further escalation. Right? One of the reasons Amos is there.,And I — he met with Israeli officials yesterday, and he’s going to continue in his — in his — during his trip to meet with Leb- — Lebanese government. And so, that’s what he’s doing today.,And so, we’ll continue efforts to secure a deal that would lead to a durable end of — end of the war in Gaza. That’s what we’re trying to do. We’re trying to make sure we get this hostage deal, working very hard in a diplomatic way. You saw Secretary Blinken in the region just last week. And we want to lower tensions. We believe this hostage deal will play a part in lowering the tensions.,And so, you heard that from the President’s remarks when he — when he laid out what that hostage deal was not too long ago. And so, we do not want to see an escalation.,Q And then just on the stretch of days that the President will be spending at Camp — Camp David. How much of that time will be devoted to debate prep? And just what have you observed the President do in recent days in terms of preparing for the debate? Like, have you seen him, you know, going back to watch previous debates between the President and the former President or anything like that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as it relates to the day prep — debate prep, that is squarely in the camp of the campaign. So, I have to keep that there. And I’m not going to — to speak in details about that.,And so, what I will say is — is that, you know, while the President is — is in — is in — is at Camp David or — and Rehoboth, he certainly will be able to be — to stay up to date on what’s going on, to get updates from — from his senior advisors, from his team.,As we say many times, the President could be president anywhere. We have the infrastructure to do just that.,I don’t have anything specific on how his time is being divided. But I can tell you this, the President is going to continue to stay squarely focused on his duty as President of the United States.,Go ahead, Karen.,Q Thanks, Karine. For today and the policy — the immigration policy. Has the President met with any families that would be impacted, that could benefit from what he’s going to announce today? Has he been moved personally by any stories that then led him to take action?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, that’s a really good question. I don’t have any families, particular- — specifically, American families, who — whose spouse is going to benefit from this. So, don’t have any — any readouts to — to speak of.,Obviously, we have heard — you all have done a really good job of covering scenarios and situations like this: families who have been pulled apart. So, we are, obviously, acutely aware of — of how that can affect — being pulled apart from your family can affect not just a family but also a community. So, we obviously are aware of that.,The President has met DACA recipients, obviously, as well, who, in a different way, have been affected by being DREAMers here. And, obviously, I talked about what they were able to do back in 2012.,And just to be very clear, what we’re talking about is not — is not part of — of DACA. Obviously, we’re doing this around the anniversary of DACA. But it is not — this announcement is not — will not affect — affect DACA recipients.,But that story is the same, right? The story of coming here for a better life and — and searching for the American Dream is very similar. And the President is going to continue to make sure that we fight to protect American families and certainly to keep them together.,Q Will there be an audience today for the remarks, anybody there that —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh —,Q — will be impacted by this?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I — I — there will be more than 200 people in the audience today. I don’t have a — I don’t have a list of particular people who will be affected by this. If we do, we certainly will share that with all of you, as we normally do. I just don’t have anything at this moment, at this time.,Go ahead, Kelly O.,Q So, as you were indicating, when the President is at Camp David, he’s still president. Do you intend to brief during the time that he is away?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: We don’t typically do traditional press briefings when the President is away. So, we do not have a scheduled formal briefing to speak of. But, obviously, we will continue — the press team and with our policy folks — as needed. We’ll continue to hold briefing calls when appropriate to preview upcoming events, upcoming announcement. That is something that we will do. And — and if you — obviously, if you all have any questions, we will be here to answer any of those questions.,Q We would request that you would brief, because it’s working days even if the President is away.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You guys want to continue seeing me?,Q We want to see you, yes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, man.,Q It’s — it’s several days.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.) Okay.,Q On the issue of — of immigration. Do you view today’s executive order as sort of a counterweight to the asylum measure that the President signed?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You know, I wouldn’t look at it that way. I really wouldn’t.,I think — and this is what I’ve been trying to say while I’ve been up here: It’s — like, this is — you know, this system is broken. More broadly, it is a broken system, right? What we’re — we’re seeing the challenges at the border. We’re seeing immigration policy that has not been revamped for some time.,And the President wants to address that. And we can do — we can, you know, do the EO and deal with the border — border security and secure the border in that way and also make sure that American families are not broken up — right? — make sure that people who have been contributing to our economy, to communities have an opportunity here.,And so, I think all of — we’re trying to really deal with a broad stroke of issues here. And that’s what you’re seeing this President do.,Q And how does he find the balance between wanting to, as you describe it, keep American families together, to select people who’ve been in the country for a longer period of time, and then the — sort of balance the fact that they would get some benefits that other immigrants would not get and have reduced penalties and that kind of thing? How does he make that balance?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, so — say more — say a little bit more.,Q Well, if — without this kind of a program —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — people would have to leave the country, they would have a longer period of time for getting a green card, those sorts of things.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, yeah.,Q So, how does he find that balance between something that is giving a benefit to people who, at one point, broke the rules?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, here’s the thing. The eligible population is limited. So, we have to remember that. And individuals who ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

re — who — who arrive now are not eligible, right? So, we did try to give this a scope, if you will.,And then — and we can’t forget, those who are eligible have been here for 23 years — in the U.S. for 23 years. And they are — that spouse, obviously, is married to someone who’s an American citizen. And they probably have children here, some of them — right? — who are American citizens because they were born here.,And so, look, we’re going to continue to take steps to — to crack down on smugglers. Right? We’re going to continue to stay — take — take steps to secure the border, you know? And so, that is something that we’re certainly going to focus on.,But I think to your — I think to answer the — the question in a more broader sense, the immigration system is broken. It is broken. It has been broken for decades — for decades. The President, on day one, wanted to get ahead of that — or try to fix that, move that forward by putting forth a [solution to the] broken immigration system.,The announcement today does not take away from the fact that the immigration system is broken. And it does not take away from the fact that Congress needs to act. And we want to see a balanced approach. We want to see a bipartisan approach to this.,And they can. They can do it. They can certainly do that.,Go ahead.,Q Following up on immigration. When you were asked about timing earlier —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — you were mentioning the President prefers to work with Congress.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q But why not earlier this year, for example, or — or late last year? I know, the bipartisan Senate bill was being worked on, but that didn’t include parole in place for spouses or anything for DACA recipients.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, I mean, look —,Q So, it seems different —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No. No, I — no, I hear you.,Q — two different tracks. Yeah.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, there’s been many phases of this, obviously. There was, first, the comprehensive immigration proposal legislation that the President introduced day one. Right?,Q Right.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And then he took — he’s taken actions — right? — from that moment, until the bipartisan discussion was happening in Senate. Like, he’s taken multiple actions, right?,And then we had an opportunity late last year, early this year to do that in a more balanced approach — right? — to do that in the Senate with both Republicans and Democrats. So, the Pre- — the President took that opportunity and directed his team to have those conversations.,And we believe that that time — what the proposal that was being put forward was going to be fair — tough, but fair.,And — and I would say, since then — since it was rejected by Republicans twice, the President has looked at every option. We say that. We say — we say that many, many times. We look at all options. And we tried to figure out how we could move forward with these different — different options and different ways.,And, look, with the — with the EO to — for — to secure the border, this is something that a majority of Americans wanted to see, right?,Q Right. No, right. I understand that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q But the — the Senate bill —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — seems separate than what’s being announced today.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, and I’m agreeing with you. But —,Q So, like, I’m under- — I’m trying to understand the impetus and why now —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. No, but I — but I’m —,Q — for the actions today.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: But I’m agreeing with you. There’s been many iterations of different ways to move forward in dealing with a broken immigration system. The first one was a comprehensive plan that the President himself put forward.,And then he took actions, right? He took other actions between then, that moment, until we got to the — until we got to the Senate and their bipartisan proposal.,And that was different. You’re right. It is very different than what you’re seeing here.,The President has always said — remember, he’s taken executive actions before. He took one very recently. And he’s looking at every way to figure out how we can have policy that’s also fair.,We’ve always said that our immigration policy needs to be fair and just. We’ve always said that. And we’ve taken different approaches. We’ve taken different action.,This is the announcement for today.,Q Is it fair to say he wanted to sign the executive order on the border before doing something like this —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — I’m —,Q — for those?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, I’m not going to get into — into that.,I think we know — right? — for some time that what we’re seeing at the border is dynamic. We saw that — right? — that they were — what — that it was important to deal with the challenges at the border. So, the President acted on that.,And we’ve always said — we’ve always said that we need an immigration policy that’s more just, that’s more fair.,I mean, let’s not forget, this is a president that was part of the DACA — right? — DREAMers getting a shot here and being able to stay and get work permits. That happened in 2012. So, there’s nothing unusual, I think, of where we are today than where the President has stood for some time, more than a decade.,And so, I think this is all part of that. This is all part of building on actions that he has taken.,He would love to see a comprehensive congressional approach. We still need that. We still need legislation. And so, he’ll continue to work on that.,Go ahead, Michael.,Q Thanks, Karine. Sticking with immigration.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q This order is almost certainly going to be challenged in court. So, I’m just wondering how confident you are that you’re on solid legal footing with this? How confident are you that this can withstand a court challenge?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we believe that this approach, this announcement that we’re taking today is squarely within our legal authorities. That’s what we believe.,Go ahead.,Q I have one on immigration, but I wanted to address the — the heat and the wildfires out West.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q How closely is the White House watching those — those wildfires? And is there any concern about the sort of early start to wildfire —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — wildfire season?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And I appreciate the question, because I think it’s really important. The President and his team are obviously closely monitoring the wildfires in California and also in New Mexico. And he has directed his team to — to do everything that they can to support state and local efforts to contain and — and suppress the fire.,Today, FEMA approved two fire management assistance grants for the South Fork Fire and the Salt Fire in New Mexico. The U.S. Forest — Forest Service is on the ground right now working directly with their state and local counterparts to fight the blaze.,We — as we do any- — anytime that we’re seeing these wildfli- — -fires, we certainly urge residents in the area to listen to local officials and heed evacuation warnings and orders. It is imperative and — and critical that they do that.,Q And then a —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And then I know you had a second question.,Q Yeah. On — on immigration.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q I just wanted to — I mean, you — you keep referring to Congress’s duty to act —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah —,Q — and the broken immigration system. Does the White House feel that the —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: But it’s true. I keep referring to it because it’s —,Q Understandable.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: — it’s true. It’s true.,Q But does — does the White House feel that it has exha- — that — that President Biden has exhausted everything that he can do on this matter —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean —,Q — by executive order?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. I mean, but, look, you see the President making announcement — he’s going to make announcement today. He took an executive action a couple of weeks ago. We continue to say we’re going to look to see what else we can do. And this is what he’s, you know, directed his team to do — right? — is to look at ways that we can deal with this — with this broken immigration system.,But this is piecemeal, right? I mean, this announcement is important. It’s going to be important and critically important to American families and their communities. It’s — it’s really important.,But as I keep saying, in order to actually deal with this issue, we have to do it in a comprehensive way. The President is going to do everything that he can. And, you know, it is — I — I mean, it is imperative for Congress to do their job and to fix the system that has been broken for decades and, you know, not listen to the former President, who’s about their own political aspirations. That’s not what we’re talking about here.,We’re talking about dealing with a system that has been broken and moving forward in a way that helps Americans — American citizens and their families.,Go ahead.,Q Thank you, Karine. Back — going back to Prime Minister Netanyahu’s —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — comments earlier. He made this pretty blistering statement in English, posted it to social media for consumption by American English-language media not long after his War Cabinet collapsed or he had to pull down his — his War Cabinet. And you just said that you have no idea what he’s talking about and that only this one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs has been paused by the President.,Is the Prime Minister lying? Is he making things up for political effect?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You would have to — I can’t speak to his political strategy, effects. That’s not something that I can speak to.,I can — I was asked a question; I answered it. I don’t know what he’s talking about. We were very clear about there being one — one shipment that we’re having — continuing to have construction conversations with Israel about. Nothing else has been paused. You heard that directly from Secretary Blinken.,I can’t — I can’t speak for the Prime Minister. He’s clearly speaking for himself.,I’m speaking on behalf of this administration. I’m speaking on behalf of this President. I just don’t have anything to add.,Q So —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I can’t — I can’t speak to his political strategy. That is not something for me to analyze —,Q Understood.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: — to do punditry from this podium.,Q Understood. So, just — just to confirm —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — anything other than the aforementioned shipment of 2,000-pound bombs, categorically untrue that it’s been paused (inaudible)?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I already answered this question. And — and categorically untrue. There is one shipment — one shipment.,All right. Go ahead, Anita.,Q Thank you. I have a question about the Resolve Tibet Act and then another on marriage. Starting with the Resolve Tibet Act: China is warning that if the President signs it, there will be, quote, “resolute measures,” end quote, against the U.S. They’re also protesting U.S. delegations, like Nancy Pelosi, who are going to India to meet with the Dalai Lama.,So, what is the White House’s response to these threats from China? And does the President plan to sign this?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, the President is going to do what he thinks is best on behalf of the American people. That’s what I can tell you.,Q Is that a yes or a no?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — he’s going to do what he thinks is best on behalf of the American people. I’m not going to get ahead of the President.,Q Cool. All right. On marriage. (Laughter.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE: It’s hot, but you’re cool.,Q Sure. (Laughter.) Cool.,On marriage. So, regarding this EO, in many states in the United States, such as my home state of Texas —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, marriage — the — yeah, okay.,Q — you have to present a stack of documents — for example, a driving license, a certified copy of a birth certificate, passport or military identification card, and Social Security cards — in order to get a marriage license.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay.,Q This — I just wonder if this puts some of these applicants in this Kafkaesque situation where they haven’t applied for this, they may have an informal marriage or a common-law marriage, and — and would that make them ineligible for this executive order? Do you accept things, like, for example, the declar- —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — the declaration of informal marriage form from states? Or is that —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I appreciate — this is a process question. I appreciate the question. You’re going to have to go to DHS to get specifics on that. I — I won’t get into details of this. But that is something that the Department of Hous- —,Q But is — is the White House concerned that, you know, asking for what amounts to paperwork, legal paperwork, for people who are undocumented and have a lack of paperwork in many critical ways might — might put them in a binding position?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I — here — I think the bottom line here is — and something to remember — that there are American families, there are people who have been here for 23 years who is mar- — who are married to American citizens and who have contributed into these communities, whether it’s the economy or, as I said, in communities. And we want to protect American citizens, American families and not separate them. And this is an opportunity to do that.,And as far as, like, what this is going to look like, what are the rules, what’s the process — that is something DHS can obviously speak to more.,But if you look at this in a more broad stroke, this is an important announcement — this is — as we’re dealing with a immi- — immigration policy that is broken, that is arcane, that has not been updated in some time.,The President is doing everything that he can within his power to deal with this — with this situation.,And, look, I’m going to be a broken record, but it is important as we’re — as I’m — as I’m trying to make my point here: Congress needs to act to actually have a comprehensive answer here, to deal with this system.,You would not be an- — asking me this specific question if Congress did not — would do their job — right? — if they would actually take action and do their job. And so, I think what’s important is this is an in- — this is a — this announcement is going to matter. It is going to matter to American citizens who are here and — and have a spouse, who have been here for more than a decade, participated in the economy, participated in their community. And I think that’s important.,Q Can I ask the last cricket question I promise I will ever ask? Did the President call the U.S. team after they beat Pakistan? And if, by some wonderful turn of events, they do win the tournament, will he be inviting them to the White House?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: What’s the interest in the cricket team? (Laughter.) No, it’s great, but I’m just —,Q Are — are you serious? Because I can answer that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, yeah, no, I’m serious.,Q Okay. So, there are 5 million people of subcontinental origin in the United States. Add to that 13 million people of West Indian origin in the United States. You may see us everywhere —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — but in terms of sports icons, we’re thin on the ground.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay.,Q To see them with the word “USA” on their chests —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: That’s pretty dope.,Q — beating the British at their own game —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yep.,Q Super satisfying. (Laughter.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Now, that’s cool. Now, that’s cool.,Q Yeah, it’s a decolonization metaphor wrapped in sports.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: That’s cool.,So, like we said yesterday, we certainly congratulate the U.S. cricket team. Obviously, what they have been able to accomplish is meaningful to many people, like yourself. And —,Q Eighteen million of us.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And — well, yeah. Eight- — you know, 18 million of you all, which I think is incredibly important. Representation matters. You hear us say that all the time.,As it relates to a call from the President, don’t have anything to share at this time.,But it — we are — certainly, we congratulate them. It is a big deal. It is indeed very, very cool. And we are very proud and excited for them.,Go ahead, Gerren.,Q Thanks, Karine. Two questions.,First, the Fearless Fund, a venture capital firm that awards grants to Black women-owned businesses, had a federal appeals court suspend their grant program due to the claim that it discriminates against white businesses. The co-founder is calling on President Biden to take executive action to, quote, “safeguard DEI initiatives and funding rights for marginalized groups.”,Similarly, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights sent a letter to the President today asking for him to — given these collective c- — asking to promote, protect, and expand programs that lead to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.,Given these concerns, does the White House believe it is doing all it can to protect diversity, equity, inclusion?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. So, I’m going to be really mindful here. It’s an ongoing litigation, so I don’t want to speak to it directly. And, you know, I don’t have any news to make, obviously, on any executive action.,But this is kind of, you know, in line to what I was just saying to Anita about how important for representation and how that matters. And the President always says, diversity is one of our greatest strengths here in this country. It kind of, really, goes in line with many of the themes of today, when we talk about immigration, when we talk about keeping talent and — and strengthening our community. It’s all — it’s all in line.,And so, what I will say more broadly is, under this administration, we’re achieving the fastest creation of Black-owned business than we’ve seen in 25 years. I think it’s about 18 million new applications in small business since this administration started. I think that’s important. And to have — to have an increase and an uptick in Black-owned business is — out of that 18 million — is actually pretty critical.,The President also signed an executive order to advance diversity and accessibility within — with — within his first six months in office.,This administration is going to keep providing economic mobility for all Americans, including — including, obviously, you know, the talent — and the talent that we see in Black communities, including women and women-owned businesses and how they contribute to our economy.,And so, that’s something that we take very seriously here in this administration. SBA takes very seriously, obviously, in the work that they have done.,And, you know, diversity is certainly one of our greatest strength, which is something that the President says over and over again.,Q Has the White House been in contact with the Fearless Fund at all?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: It’s — if we have been in contact with the Fearless Fund, I don’t have any calls or meetings to speak to.,And we — we’re just going to be super mindful. As I just stated at the top in answering your question, this is an ongoing lit- — litigation. So, we want to be super careful here.,Q And just one other question.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sure.,Q Given the President’s actions on marijuana reform, does the White House have a response to Maryland Governor Wes Moore pardoning 175,000 marijuana convictions, which has been hailed as a major racial justice effort?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, we certainly welcome the news. And it builds on the President’s work to reform how nations approaches marijuana. And the President has said — he called, you know, for governors to — to do their part and to take action. So, this is welcomed, as I just stated.,And, you know, in addition to rescheduling — the process to reschedule marijuana, the President has been clear that no one — no one should be in jail just for possessing marijuana. And he has a record number of pardons for prior federal offenses of simple possession and use of marijuana. And he has con- — will continue to urge all governors to do the same.,And so, we see that in Maryland. We saw that in Massachusetts. We saw that in Oregon. And so, he commends and welcomes, certainly, this news.,Go ahead, Aurelia.,AIDE: Karine, you have time for one more.,Q On heat waves. Climate experts —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sorry — sorry, can you start from the beginning. I’m sorry.,Q Yeah, on heat waves.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay, yeah.,Q According to climate experts, to advocacy groups, these heat waves are going to become more frequent, last longer, start earlier. Is the federal response and relief system adequately equipped to deal with this threat?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we’re — we are doing everything that we can to — to do — to deal with what we’re seeing: the heat wave. And you’ve heard us talk about climate change, and the President has taken, certainly, strong actions — pro- — progressive actions to deal with climate change. You see that in the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the biggest — biggest legislation to actually deal with climate change.,But the President is going to continue to work — to work in lowering cool- — cooling costs — I think that’s important — and keep Americans safe from extreme temperatures.,A couple things that I just want to lay out.,HHS launched a nationwide effort to help local officials identify communities most vulnerable to extreme heat and target resources to those communities.,The Department of Labor is all — is using all of its existing tools to protect workers from extreme heat. Since 2022, they have conducted over 5,000 federal heat-related inspections.,And we have provided billions of dollars to cities nationwide to help build resilience against climate impacts, like heat wave, including by expanding access to cooling systems for public housing residents.,This is why the Inflation Reduction Act, which, by the way only Democrats voted for — for it, was so critical and so important in providing those types of resources as well.,I think I have to — go ahead, Jared. And then I have to wrap it up.,Q I just have a follow-up to something that came up yesterday when you were asked about the President making comments about potential Supreme Court nominations. I was just curious —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — unrelated to the campaign, how far along is the President kind of thinking about who he’d want to nominate in the event that he has more nominations?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.) Wow. That’s a — that’s way into the future.,Q I mean, he brought it up in the fun- — he brought it up sort of in the campaign. But it —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, yeah.,Q Is that something he’s thinking about?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, you — as you said, you heard directly from the President. He brought it up in — in a campaign stop, obviously, this weekend in — in Los Angeles.,I don’t have anything more on the President’s thinking or a list for you all at this time.,But, I guess, what I like to say is: Stay tuned. Stay tuned.,All right, everybody. Thank you so much.,Q Thanks.,2:44 P.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington," DC 20500""",18-06-24,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/06/18/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-63/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Coordinated Field Office,Atlanta, Georgia,3:10 P.M. EDT,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hey, everybody.  (Applause.),Can we hear it for Helen Butler?  (Applause.),Well, it is good to be back in Atlanta.  You know, I was just here last week.  Somebody asked me if I was moving here.  I said, “Maybe.”  (Laughs.),But I want to thank everybody just so very much for all the work and all the leaders who are here.  I was saying to somebody, Helen Butler has been doing this work — I’ve been — I have been visiting with her and working with her here in Atlanta for years.  And I know there are so many extraordinary leaders here who understand the importance of this election and the power that we have to make a difference and to decide the trajectory, the focus of our country in terms of knowing what we are entitled to receive from our government and its leaders and the work that is necessary to achieve that end.,So, I want to thank everyone.  And I want to wish everybody a happy Juneteenth.  (Applause.),So, when I was in the United States Senate, I was very proud to be a sponsor of the legislation that made Juneteenth a federal holiday.  And when I think about what we know — and folks in Atlanta and so many parts of our country have traditions — longstanding traditions of how to celebrate Juneteenth and what it means.,But, in particular, when we think about what’s at stake in our country right now in the context of those who would deny our history, who would have us erase history, who would try to rewrite our history in this year of our Lord, 2024 — those who are banning books — we know that as we celebrate this — the most recent, the newest federal holiday in America — that it is incumbent on all of us in our celebration to dedicate ourselves to knowing our history, to dedicating ourselves to what must not be repeated about our history, knowing we can never take any of the gains we have made for granted unless we are vigilant in protecting fundamental freedoms.,And that’s how I know we think about Juneteenth.  I have issued a call to action.  I have actually asked that on Juneteenth, in the many ways that we have traditionally celebrated it, now that it is a federal holiday, let’s also incorporate into our tradition our new traditions that we will think of Juneteenth of a day for us to have a call to action to register folks to vote.  (Applause.),So, let that now — as we create traditions on top of those that have existed, think of Juneteenth as our call to action to register folks to vote.  Because, after all, what we know is so much about our history has been about those that would try and deny us our rights and how we must be proactive and exercise self-determination to make real our power and the promise of America.  And one of the most significant ways in election time that we do that is to vote.,An election that is going to determine the next generation or many of our country is happening in 140 days — in 140 days.  And it is so important that remind people — that we remind people of their power at this very moment — their power of their voice through their vote.,And so, that’s part of what we are doing with the kickoff of this campaign headquarters is, through this office right here, we will gather, we will organize, we will build community, we will build coalitions all around reminding people that we are all in this together and that there is power in the collective and in our unity.,What we will be doing here over the course of the next 140 days is organizing folks.  We’re going to be emailing.  We’re going to be texting.  We’re going to be calling.  We’re going to be knocking on doors.  (Applause.)  We’re going to be looking to our right and looking to our left and saying, “Neighbor, you know your vote is important.  You know you” —,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.),THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s exactly right.  You have a right to have your voice heard at election time.,And so, let’s make sure that we do a couple of things.  First of all, let’s remember recent history.  The state of Georgia and the voters of Georgia turned out in record numbers in 2020 — in record numbers.  Young voters turned out in record numbers in 2020, which is how Joe Biden became President of the United States and I became Vice President of the United States.  (Applause.),The voters of Georgia turned out in record numbers and sent Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to the United States Senate — (applause) — defying some people who dare to define who the state of Georgia is and what that looks like.,Georgia voters made a decision that, in spite of intents and plans to make it more difficult for you to vote, you would find a way around those obstacles to not ever let anybody suppress your voice — (applause) — despite the fact that in the state of Georgia a law was passed to make it illegal to give people food and water for standing in line to vote.  The hypocrisy abounds.  Whatever happened to “love thy neighbor”?,And then, in May, the governor of Georgia signed three bills into law — one of them which is going to mean that certain people can make decisions about fewer voting machines in polling places.  You know why?  Well, my theory of it — which is a logical theory and a reasonable theory of it — is because then they can start taking machines from certain polling places to make people have to stand in line longer to dissuade people from being able to have their voice count at election time.,Because what we know is the folks who have everything at stake are often the folks who have a whole lot of obligations in their life.  They have kids that they got to take care of.  They have jobs they have to work at.  They’re caring for other people.  And so, to make it more difficult for them to vote by saying that you’re going to have to stand in line longer, that’s a disgrace.  You should be making it easier for working people to vote.  (Applause.),Passed a law to now make it more easier to kick people off the voter rolls in Georgia, which is why, as we celebrate Juneteenth and our call to action, let’s ensure that everybody who thinks they’re registered to vote actually goes to IWillVote.com to make sure you’re registered to vote, make sure you didn’t get kicked off, because the worst thing that can happen — and, you know, disappointment is one of the worst emotions that anybody can experience — is that somebody thinks they’re actually registered, fills out their ballot, they’re ready to vote, and then they go to vote and learn that they’ve been kicked off.,So, let’s think about Juneteenth as a way that reaffirms our commitment to holding on to our freedoms and rights, especially in this environment where there is a full-on intent to attack fundamental freedoms and right — be it the freedom to have access to the ballot; be it the freedom to learn America’s full history; be it the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what she’s supposed to do — (applause); be it the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride; be it the freedom to be free from hate and bigotry, be free from the fear of gun violence.,All of these things are at stake in this upcoming election.  And the way we will determine the course of our country is to remind our neighbors and our friends and our family they have the power.,Because I’ll close with this.  Ultimately, this election is coming down to a choice for each of us to determine and decide what kind of country we want to live in.  That’s what this is about: What kind of country do you want to live in?,You got the former President trying to be president again, who openly admires dictators, who talks about how he’s going to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies — somebody who says he’s proud that he has taken fundamental rights from the women of America.,On the other hand, you have in Joe Biden and our administration an administration that has taken on the issue of affordable prescription medication and finally capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month.  (Applause.)  Black folks are 60 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.  How many of our seniors, for years, had to make a choice about whether they could either afford to fill their prescription or fill their refrigerator?,What our administration has done — what we have done — I say as a proud HBCU graduate — (applause) — we gave over $15 billion to our HBCUs, recognizing them to be the centers of academic excellence that they are.  (Applause.),What we have done to close the racial wealth gap in America — the lowest unemployment numbers in recent history for Black Americans.,What we have done to increase access to capital.,What we have done with student loan forgiveness.  And, by the way, there were a whole lot of people didn’t want us to do that.  We’ve now forgiven over $160 billion in student loan debt.  (Applause.)  I ask everybody: Testify, when you know that that’s what you’ve experienced, to let everybody know.,What we have done to deal with medical debt.  What is medical debt?  Most often comes about because somebody experiences a medical emergency.  They didn’t ask for that.  And what that means in terms of the debt that they start to pile up around those bills that were unexpected.  We are the ones who said medical debt should not be used against somebody, and we have now eliminated the ability of medical debt to be on your credit score — (applause) — which means medical debt can no longer be a barrier to you being able to qualify for a lease on an apartment or a car loan or a home loan.,These are the kinds of things we have done.  And I will end by saying it’s because the voters in Georgia, the leaders here took it upon yourselves to activate, to organize, to mobilize.  And we’ve seen the power of that, which is why there are some people still trying to work against it.  But we’ve seen the power of that.,And we’re never going to let anybody take our power from us.  We will never let anybody silence us.  That’s what this election is about.  (Applause.),And the people of Georgia are going to make the decision.  And the decision will be four more years.  (Applause.),Thank you, everyone.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.),END                       3:21 P.M.

The President and the Vice President know that the cost of housing is too high. That’s why the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) created PRO Housing a first-of-its-kind program that provides funding to communities actively addressing barriers to building new units. Funding will support updates to state and local housing plans, land use policies, permitting processes, and other actions aimed at building and preserving more affordable housing.,We are starting to see some progress. More housing units are under construction during this Administration than at any time in the last 50 years, rents have fallen over the last year in many places, and the homeownership rate is higher now than before the pandemic. But rent is still too high, and Americans who want to buy a home still have difficulty finding one they can afford. That is why President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to lower housing costs, including by increasing housing supply by building and preserving more homes. In the State of the Union, President Biden called on Congress to pass his and Vice President Harris’s plan to build two million additional homes, increase rental assistance, and help first-time and first-generation homebuyers.,Recognizing that every community is different, the grants announced today are critical to breaking down local barriers that stand in the way of housing development and lower costs. Common barriers to housing identified in the PRO Housing applications include the high cost of land and development, underutilized vacant land and property, aging housing stock, inadequate infrastructure, displacement pressures, risks of extreme weather or environment hazards, and outdated land-use and permitting policies and processes.,The demand for these awards was substantial, with requests exceeding $13 for every $1 available. Applications came from more than 175 communities across 47 states and territories, representing diverse demographics and geographic settings. The Biden-Harris Administration will also release an additional $100 million in PRO Housing funding later this summer.,The awards announced today build upon the historic levels of funding made available for housing, infrastructure, and community resilience by the Biden-Harris Administration. The President’s FY25 Budget proposes a historic investment of more than $258 billion in housing, including a $20 billion Innovation Fund for Housing Expansion, which would provide critical support to further eliminate barriers to housing, spur development, and encourage innovative housing solutions. The President’s FY25 Budget also proposes an additional $100 million request for PRO Housing grants. Vice President Harris has been highlighting the Administration’s investments in affordable housing and homeownership as part of her nationwide Economic Opportunity Tour in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.,“President Biden and I believe that every American deserves affordable housing so they have a roof over their head and a place to call home. That is why we have a plan to build millions of new units of affordable housing in communities all across our nation, which will bring down the cost of housing for renters and help more Americans buy a home,”,said Vice President Harris.,“Today, I am proud to announce that we are taking a critical step forward by investing $85 million to help more than 20 communities throughout our country remove barriers to building more affordable housing.”,HUD is awarding $85 million in funding through PRO Housing to 21 winners. The winners include jurisdictions ranging from under 5,000 residents in a rural community to millions of people across an urban county. In addition to the grant funding, winners will be invited to participate in a technical assistance cohort to facilitate peer learning and implementation support. HUD will also offer technical assistance for communities who applied for round one funding and other HUD grantees committed to addressing barriers to housing – highlighting how annual grants and low-cost federal financing can be used to adopt housing-forward strategies and boost housing supply.,“President Biden and Vice President Harris have prioritized reducing housing costs,”,said HUD Acting Secretary Todman,. “As I travel across the country, I hear from people all the time, including builders, elected officials, and other stakeholders, about how difficult it is to build housing. This is why I am pleased to announce our first round of PRO Housing funding, which will provide communities with incentives to address their local housing barriers. This expands on our ongoing efforts to lower housing costs by increasing the housing supply.”,The PRO Housing winners have already invested in strategies to boost housing supply, reform local regulations, incentivize development, prevent displacement, and encourage community driven solutions.,This announcement fulfills a commitment made in the Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan, and builds on sweeping actions to reduce barriers, boost housing supply, and lower costs, including:,The Vice President’s announcement builds on her career of working to protect homeowners and address housing supply and affordability. As Attorney General of California, she helped pass the California Homeowner Bill of Rights to provide protections to homeowners facing foreclosure. As U.S. Senator, she introduced several bills to increase the supply of affordable housing and lower costs for renters.,Now as Vice President, she has led several announcements to ensure all families have a safe and affordable place to live, including $5.5 billion in new funding to boost affordable housing, invest in economic growth, build wealth, and address homelessness across America. The Vice President has also led the charge on addressing racial bias in home appraisals by announcing key actions of the PAVE Action Plan, including steps taken to make it easier for more homeowners to appeal home appraisals that may be undervalued because of racial bias.,# # #,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",26-06-24,FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces First-of-Its-Kind Funding to Lower Housing Costs by Reducing Barriers to Building More Homes,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/26/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-first-of-its-kind-funding-to-lower-housing-costs-by-reducing-barriers-to-building-more-homes/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marcum,as being outside the scope of,Lawrence v. Texas,as applied in the military context, 60 M.J. 198, 207–08 (2004).,The Military Departments (Army, Navy, or Air Force), or in the case of the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, shall provide information about and publicize application procedures for certificates of pardon.  An applicant for a certificate of pardon under this proclamation is to submit an application to the Military Department (Army, Navy, or Air Force) that conducted the court-martial or, in the case of a Coast Guard court-martial, to the Department of Homeland Security.  If the relevant Department determines that the applicant satisfies the criteria under this proclamation, following a review of relevant military justice records, the Department shall submit that determination to the Attorney General, acting through the Pardon Attorney, who shall then issue a certificate of pardon along with information on the process to apply for an upgrade of military discharge.  My Administration strongly encourages veterans who receive a certificate of pardon to apply for an upgrade of military discharge.,Although the pardon under this proclamation applies only to the convictions described above, there are other LGBTQI+ individuals who served our Nation and were convicted of other crimes because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  It is the policy of my Administration to expeditiously consider and to make final pardon determinations with respect to such individuals.,IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.,JOSEPH R.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,National Security Council,Via Teleconference,10:34 A.M. EDT,MODERATOR:  Hey.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining today’s News of the Day Gaggle with White House National Security Comms Advisor John Kirby.  I’ll turn it over to him for a topper, and then we’ll take some of your questions.,MR. KIRBY:  Good morning, everybody.  So, just right off the top, since I know many of you are closely tracking the events out of Nairobi, we hope you can understand that this is an evolving situation and we’re working to obtain and to help you get as much information as quickly as possible.,We’ve all seen the reporting, and I just want to stress again that the United States is deeply concerned about and we condemn the reported violence in all its forms.  We offer our deepest condolences, of course, to the families who have been impacted by this violence.  And we continue to urge restraint so that no further Kenyans are put in harm’s way while exercising their right to peaceful public assembly.  That right is protected by the Kenyan constitution, and we believe it must be respected.,The United States has been in touch with the Kenyan government to urge appropriate use of force by the police, to respect human rights, and quite frankly, to respect due process for those that have been detained.  And we will continue to push for calm to prevail.,And now, yesterday — switching to Haiti — the Multinational Security Support Mission, that will grow eventually to 2,500 multinational personnel, arrived in Haiti.  As you know, this effort is being led by Kenya and with strong support from the United States.  The mission includes personnel, financial support from over a dozen countries that will support the Haitian National Police as they increase their anti-gang operations, build their capacity to maintain public safety, and to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches everybody in need.,The United States is this particular mission’s largest financial contributor and the largest donor to Haiti in general, providing more than $300 million and up to $60 million in equipment.  And we’re going to continue our diplomatic outreach to encourage others to join that effort as well.,We’ve also worked with Kenya and other partners to integrate critically important accountability and oversight measures into the mission.,Now, I want to be clear right at the top here: This mission is not going to solve all of Haiti’s problems, but it is a good, positive first step and to provide the best chance for Haiti to get on a path toward democratic governance and rule of law.  It is about making the Haitian National Police better — better resourced, better led, better trained, better capable.  That’s what this is about, and we’re going into it with that in mind.,Shifting topics, if I could: Today, we also welcomed the announcement that Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will serve as the next Secretary General of NATO.  President Biden and Prime Minister Rutte have worked very closely together over the past decade when Joe Biden was Vice President and, of course, now that he’s Commander-in-Chief.  And they work together on a variety of issues, including our shared strong support for Ukraine, on safeguarding advanced technologies, and strengthening the transatlantic alliance.  President Biden strongly believes that Mark Rutte will make an excellent Secretary General.  And he’s grateful for his willingness to serve in that capacity.,We’d also like to thank, of course, Jens Stoltenberg for a decade of service to the Alliance during the most consequential period of European security since World War Two.  Under his leadership, the NATO Alliance has become larger and stronger, and Allied unity is at an all-time high, which has been an important priority for President Biden.,And that takes us right — I mean, his leadership has really guided us right toward next month’s 75th anniversary summit for NATO, here in Washington, D.C., which will be followed by the leadership transition, of course, in the fall when President — I’m sorry, when Secretary General Stoltenberg steps down and the new Secretary General, Mark Rutte, steps into the job.,Finally, as you all know, Evan Gershkovich appeared in court today for the start of what we view as nothing more than a sham trial.  I’ll state it again: Evan has never been employed by the United States government.  Evan is not a spy.  Journalism is not a crime.  And Evan should never have been detained in the first place.,Russia has failed to justify Evan’s continued detention.  He, like fellow American Paul Whelan, is simply being used as a bargaining chip.  Embassy Moscow was granted brief access to the courtroom before the proceedings began today.  They were not permitted to speak with Evan.  So, obviously, we’re going to follow this closely.  And of course, our embassy in Moscow will continue to seek to attend any and all future hearings.,Now, look, I think this goes without saying too, but all of us — all of us admire Evan’s resilience.  I’ve seen a reporting that his friends say he continues to be in good spirits, which is just incredible given what he’s going through.  While he shouldn’t be going through these proceedings at all, it’s always reassuring to see his smile and to hear reports of his morale.,We want both Evan and Paul to know that we all care deeply about their wellbeing and that this administration will continue to do everything it can to bring them home, and that includes, right now, the effort to try to find a way to get these guys released back to their families, where they belong, is ongoing.  It’s alive, and we’re keeping at it.,And with that, I can start taking some questions.,MODERATOR:  Thanks.  First up, we’ll go to Aamer Madhani.,Q    Hey there, John.  Is Israel’s launch — is an Israeli launch, cross-border offensive, Lebanon (inaudible) Hezbollah — if that were to happen, will the U.S. back Israel militarily?,And then secondly, on the Assange case, was the White House involved in helping forge the agreement that led to Assange’s release?  And has the President discussed the matter with the prime minister or any other Australian government officials ahead of the announcement?  Thank you.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, the White House was not involved in any way whatsoever in Julian Assange’s case, and the decisions pursuant to that, to his sentencing and his repatriation back to Israel.  That was a DOJ matter, and they’re the only ones that can speak to it.,I don’t have any conversations to read out to you from the President with respect to this.  The White House was not involved in any way.,On your first question — look, first and foremost, we don’t want to see a second front opened up, period.  And that’s why we’ve been working so hard on diplomacy and trying to find a way diplomatically to prevent that from happening.  We don’t believe that it’s going to be in anybody’s interest, quite frankly, least of all the Israeli people.  So we’re working diplomatically to prevent that outcome from happening.  That’s where our focus is on.,But as we have said repeatedly, and as we will continue to say: We stand with Israel.  We’re going to continue to make sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself.  And as the President has proven in the past, if there’s a way we can prevent further attacks on Israel, we’ll do that.  And certainly, we’re going to continue to help Israel defend itself; that’s not going to change.,But as for a hypothetical, specifically with respect to the northern border line, the Blue Line there with Lebanon, again, we want to see no second front opened, and we want to see if we can’t resolve the tensions out there through diplomatic processes.,MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Jeff Mason.,Q    Thank you very much.  John, Jake Sullivan has a meeting today with Mr. Gallant of Israel.  Could you give us a sense of what you expect the two of them to discuss and also what time that is and whether or not we should expect a readout?,MR. KIRBY:  Hey, Jeff.  You broke up a little bit, but I think I got the gist of the question.  This was about Jake’s meeting with Defense Minister Gallant.,Q    Yes.,MR. KIRBY:  He’s meeting with him as we speak, Jeff.  That meeting started a little bit after nine o’clock.  And as far as I know, sitting here, it’s still ongoing.  And we absolutely will have a readout of it.,Broadly speaking, I don’t think you should expect any major surprises coming out of this discussion.  I mean, Jake is looking forward to sitting down with Defense Minister Gallant to talk about what’s going on in Gaza; to talk about — to get a sense of Israeli operations, not only what they look like now, but what they’re going to look like in the future; to talk about how we’re going to continue to defend Israel and make sure that they have what they need.,And obviously, they will talk about the — what Aamer just asked me about — the tensions up near Lebanon and that border, and what the path forward could look like for a diplomatic solution to this, to prevent a second front from opening up.,I have every expectation that they will talk about the broader concerns of Iran in the region and their destabilizing behavior and the manner in which they, Iran, continue to resource, to fund, to support, to train groups that are now attacking Israel but also are supporting such attacks.,So I think the full range of topics will be discussed.  I think, also, I would have every expectation that the humanitarian situation will be front and center for Jake, for sure.  He’ll want to talk to the Israelis about what more we can do to get more trucks in and not only get them in, but get them to the people that most need that aid and assistance.,As you know, though Kerem Shalom is open and trucks are queued up outside, not a lot of them are getting in, and it’s not because of the Israelis; it’s largely because just criminal gangs now are looting these trucks.  And the World Food Program and the U.N. drivers are obviously concerned about getting attacked.  And so, we’re going have to continue to work with the Israelis to try to address that problem as well.,So, again, I think a broad, big agenda, lots to talk about, but we’ll have a readout when it’s over.,MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Kellie Meyer.  You should be able to unmute yourself.,Q    Hi, John.  Thanks for doing this.  A couple quick questions just on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs warning of a threat to U.S. troops in the region — as we’ve been discussing, the tensions between Hezbollah and Israel.  Any more precautions that are being taken that you can speak to right now?,MR. KIRBY:  One of the things I’m very careful to do is not talk about the specifics on force protection and what we do to ensure force protection.  I would refer you to the Chairman to speak to that more.  I don’t know how much more he’d get into that.,We’re certainly mindful of the risk to our troops and our facilities throughout the region.  And that risk has certainly not mitigated in recent months, obviously, with what’s going on.  So it’s something we’re watching very closely.  We continue to monitor it.  We also modify force protection procedures and protocols as the threat changes, and it does change.  But I think I need to leave it there.,MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Aurelia.,Q    Hi.  Thanks so much for taking my question.  A follow-up on Kenya.  Not that long ago, President Ruto was at the White House, and President Biden said Kenya and the United States share democratic values.  Would you say that this is maybe — this is still the case after the response to the protests?  And more generally, does the administration condemn the use of force against the protesters?  Otherwise, how would you qualify what Kenyan police did in Nairobi?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ll tell you, you know, as a democracy, the Kenyan constitution does allow for the use of defense forces to augment police, particularly like in protecting critical infrastructure.  At the same time, that same constitution includes freedom of assembly and the right to protest peacefully, and calls for the government of Kenya to respect the rights of all its citizens.,So, again, we remain deeply concerned about the violence that we’ve seen, and we absolutely condemn the violence.  We don’t want to see anybody hurt.  And that includes violence that’s perpetrated on innocent, peaceful protesters.,So we’re going to be in touch.  We have been in touch.  We’re going to stay in touch with our Kenyan colleagues as appropriate.,MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Alex Ward.,Q    John, I know — thanks for doing this.  I know, you know, the administration has responded a thousand times to the stuff about, you know, the weapons delays or — reported weapons delays, et cetera.  But there’s been reporting today that, basically, it seems like there’s been a — because the U.S. has sent so many weapons ahead of time, there’s just been sort of a lower amount headed now, and wondering if you think that might be the issue.,And then, sort of number two here, relatedly is: Is Netanyahu someone the administration really feels they can work with now?  Obviously, he is the prime minister, and he is — but he is the interlocutor, but is he someone you guys feel you can have good-faith conversations with about this conflict now?  Thanks.,MR. KIRBY:  Alex, on your first question, I just want to make a couple of points, because I’m not going to — I can’t speak to the State Department process here.  They run this process by which foreign military sales and provisions of weapons and assistance, you know, get to Israel.  So I’ll let them speak to sequencing and timing.  You know, we don’t have perfect visibility on that here to speak to that reporting and that process.,I would just tell you, number one: Aid and assistance, military assistance, continues to flow to Israel; that we are in constant touch with our Israeli counterparts about what they need and doing everything we can to get them what they need.  I mean, my goodness, you have the defense minister here today.  Actually, you know, this week he’s been here having meetings; met with Blinken, met with Austin, and now he’s meeting with Jake today.  I mean, nobody can say that we’re not attune to and staying in touch with the Israelis about what they need.,Number two, as you and I speak here, Alex, there remains only one shipment of high-density, low-precision munitions that has been paused.  Everything else continues to flow.  Again, on the timeline, you know, I’d have to — and the sequencing — I’d have to refer you to State.  But Israel continues to get arms and ammunition.  It continues to flow.  We want to make sure that they have what they need.  And that will — that commitment will not waver.,On your second question, at the risk of sounding repetitive, I would just tell you that these are two leaders who have known each other a long, long time — decades.  And they come from different political traditions.  They have differing views on a number of issues that are germane not only to the region, but certainly specific to Israel.  And they are absolutely competent and capable of being honest with one another.  He is the elected prime minister of the State of Israel, and he, therefore, is the leader that we will work with and we have worked with him.,I’m not saying that it’s all been smooth in every single instance, including in recent days, but we are not going to get into — we’re not going to respond to every one of the Prime Minister’s political statements and his public pronouncements.  What we’re focused on is making sure, again, that they have what they need.  And we believe we’re fully capable of doing that with Prime Minister Netanyahu and with this government.,And that’s what we’re focused on.  It’s head down — it’s making sure that Israel can defend itself, but just as critically, as I said earlier, that we continue to get humanitarian assistance in to the people who are in need and that we get this ceasefire deal in place.,It’s one of the things that — we haven’t talked about it this morning, but we’re still working with the Prime Minister and his team to try to get the ceasefire deal in place so that we can potentially end this conflict.  And that’s what we’re focused on.  And that means we’re going to stay focused on that effort with the Prime Minister and his team because he’s the government in place.,MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Brad Dress.,Q    Yeah, thank you.  Just one question.  So, despite U.S. efforts, the Houthis are continuing to attack merchant ships.  And now they appear to be getting more successful.  Why are efforts not working?  And do you think the U.S. needs a new strategy to deter that?  Thank you.,MR. KIRBY:  I think a couple of things are germane here.  There’s a religious fervor that the Houthi leadership have instilled into this effort.  As I went to the podium a while ago — a week or so ago — and laid out for everybody, this isn’t about standing up for the people of Gaza.  It’s not about — it’s not some popular movement to assist people in the region, because the ships that they’re hitting, sometimes, in one case in particular, was meant to go to a Yemeni port to bring in grain to hungry people in Yemen.  They have instilled this sort of religious fervor to this and made it some sort of cause célèbre here.  And when you do that, it becomes even more difficult to, as you put it, deter and dissuade.  We’re mindful of that.,So what we’re focused on is taking away their capability to conduct the attacks.  And that is why we continue to hit targets inside Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen where we think an attack is imminent and about to occur.  We’re going to continue to do that.  That’s why we still have a coalition of 20-some-odd nations operating in the Red Sea and beyond to try to defend against these attacks.,And while, yes, they have had a couple of successful strikes in most recent days — and I know one vessel in particular sank as a result of the attack — by and large, most of their attacks are not successful.  You don’t see press releases about it; you don’t necessarily see video of it.  But they miss a whole hell of a lot more than they hit, and that’s because we’re out there working hard to make sure that that’s the outcome, at the same time making sure that we’re doing everything we can to try to degrade their capabilities.,But they’re still getting supplied; they’re still getting resourced by Iran.  And as I said earlier, I have no doubt that that will be a topic of discussion when Jake and Defense Minister Gallant speak today, about what we can do together to try to take away some of those capabilities.  And that’s what we’re focused on.,MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Nadia Charters.,Q    Thank you, Eduardo.  Hi, John.  A couple of questions.  Canada has called its citizens to leave Lebanon.  What is the U.S. assessment regarding a similar call?  I know you have not done something similar to that.  Do you believe that the situation is safe for U.S. citizens to stay in Lebanon?,And second, any update — I know you mentioned the negotiation with Hamas.  Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think Hamas is insisting that they will accept the deal if phase three clearly calls for the end of the war.  And this is the sticking point with the Israelis.  Israelis said we’re happy to go along, but phase three does not mean end of the war.  Can you just give us your perspective on that?  Thank you.,MR. KIRBY:  On your first question, I’m going to refer you to the State Department.  Obviously, we want all Americans in Lebanon who are still there, either on business or other travel, to be as careful as possible to make sure that they have registered with the State Department system so that the State Department can stay in regular touch with them and that they do everything they can to be — to watch out for their own safety.,But as for any announcements or pronouncements, that’s really a State Department call, and I’d have to refer you to them.,Clearly, nothing is more important to President Biden than the safety and security of Americans wherever they are.  And that includes overseas, and that certainly includes a place like Lebanon.,What we’re trying to do is prevent a second front from opening up.  We’re trying to prevent an escalation of this conflict that certainly would put the people of Israel and of Lebanon at greater physical risk than the risk that is already being incurred by them, particularly those that live near the Blue Line.  We want to prevent that outcome, which is why we have been working so hard diplomatically and intensely, thus so, to prevent a second front from opening up and an expansion of this conflict.,But we will, as appropriate, of course, stay in touch with all Americans in Lebanon.  Those that sign up to be informed, we’ll make sure that they have the latest and greatest information.,But as for any particular pronouncements, that would be a State Department call.,On your second question, the President laid this out really, really well at the end of May.  He laid out the entire, sort of, phasing of this process.  And it is advancing that phasing and that process that we’re focused on, where you want to get to phase one.  Phase one gives you six weeks of a ceasefire; it gives you more humanitarian assistance, up to 600 trucks a day; and obviously, critically, it gets a first rendering of hostages — women, children, the elderly, sick — out quickly, back to their families.,And then as the President laid out, Nadia, while phase one is ongoing, the two sides then begin to negotiate phase two.  So, I understand.  I’ve seen public pronouncements and comments of people, you know, on either side, where they want to sort of leapfrog over the process.  But the process as we’ve laid out, the process that Israel itself proposed and has endorsed calls for phase two negotiations to begin when phase one is agreed to and underway, that’s the process that we still believe is the right one and the appropriate one.  And that’s the one that we’re going to continue to talk to both sides about.,And we still believe that discussions about it are valuable and warranted.  And we’re going to do everything we can to see if we can’t get phase one implemented and started so that the rest of the process can take place.,Then last thing I’ll say is, as the President said in his speech on the 31st of May, that you get to phase two — if you can get phase two negotiated and complete, well, that potentially — you know, that gives you a potential cessation to the hostilities itself.,MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Marek.,Q    Thank you, Eduardo.  Hi, John.  One question.  According to Reuters, two close advisors to Donald Trump have presented him with a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, in essence by forcing Ukraine to the negotiating table and the ceasefire based on so-called prevailing battle lines.  From what we know about the plan right now, which side would this plan benefit if it’s implemented?  And does it make sense, this framework?  Does it make sense to you?,MR. KIRBY:  Look, I think you all know — I think I missed the beginning of your question.  But is this a proposal put forth by folks on the Trump team?  Is that what you were saying?,Q    Yes.  General Kellogg and — they say that they have positive feedback from former president.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I thought that’s what you said.,Look, I would just — I would just say a couple of things here.  First of all, in our view, I’m not going to comment about the 2024 election.  I’m not going to get, you know, into a public debate here with respect to what former President Trump’s advisors may or may not be talking to him about it.,So, with that as a caveat, the President’s commitment to supporting Ukraine has been manifestly steady and strident and consistent.  We built a global coalition now — more than 50 countries that are supporting Ukraine as they defend themselves.  He just signed at the G7 in Italy, a week or so ago, a historic bilateral security agreement with Ukraine.  And he understands — he understands that the stronger Ukraine’s position is on the battlefield, the stronger they will be at the negotiating table when that time comes, Marek.  And you know who gets to decide when that time comes?  President Zelenskyy.  And nobody else.,And what we’ve said is: Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.  And we’re standing strong to make sure that President Zelenskyy has everything he needs so that if and when he’s ready to go to the table, he can do it from a position of strength and that he knows he’s got our backing and the backing of those some 50-some-odd countries.,Unlike some folks, President Biden believes that any decisions about negotiations, quite frankly, have got to be up to President Zelenskyy and Ukraine.  We’re not going to force Ukraine to surrender any of its territory, because we understand that if Putin is allowed to conquer Ukraine and subjugate its people, any of its people, the consequences would be severe.  He and dictators all around the world would just be emboldened, and we think the world would be a much more dangerous place.,I think that pretty much sums up our views.,MODERATOR:  Next up, we’ll go to Laura Kelly.,Q    Hi.  Thank you for taking my question.  Just going back to the distribution of aid in Gaza, what is the White House position on where responsibility for distribution rests?  There’s this blame game going on between Israel and the international aid organizations with security inside Gaza for distribution being seen — I think is one of the major impediments.  So who’s responsible for security at this point?  What does the White House want to see happen?,MR. KIRBY:  We want to see the ceasefire deal in place.  We want to get that ceasefire deal in place —,Q    But, like, while you’re working on the ceasefire deal.,MR. KIRBY:  No, but — let me finish.,We want to see the ceasefire deal in place.  Because if you get that ceasefire deal in place, you get six weeks of calm; you get six weeks of calm, you can maybe get up to several hundred trucks a day.  And the goal of phase one is 600 trucks a day.  So you ask me what we want to see.  We want to see this deal put in place, which is why we —,Q    So the challenge of getting — the challenge of not distributing humanitarian aid is pressure on Hamas to go to the ceasefire deal?,MR. KIRBY:  No.  Look, there’s a lot of reasons why aid and assistance is being held up.  One of the principal reasons right now is criminal gangs that are operating particularly at Kerem Shalom.  That’s not the Israelis’ fault.  And as far as we know, these gangs have no connection to Hamas specifically.,So we’re going to continue to work with the U.N.  We’ve been talking to the U.N. about seeing if we can’t help get them personal protective gear and equipment, communications, radio communication, so that their truck drivers can feel a little bit more safe, which you can’t very well blame these guys for being a little bit nervous about driving a truck into Gaza when their convoys and their trucks could be attacked by these criminal gangs and thugs.  And we — so we’re going to obviously work with them and the IDF to see what can be done about that.,But, yes, look, security of these convoys is a live issue.  And I’m not trying to pull — take Hamas off the hook here, because Hamas has, in fact, allowed some of this activity to go on and don’t have the best interests of the people of Gaza forefront in their minds.  In fact, we’ve all seen Sinwar’s comments about how civilian casualties and civilian suffering actually works — he believes works to his advantage.  So, Hamas is absolutely partly responsible here for this as well.,But there’s — you know, it’s a combat zone.  And combat operations and combat areas certainly make the delivery of humanitarian assistance a lot more challenging.  So we’re going to continue to talk to the U.N., we’re going to talk to the IDF about what we can do to make it safer and to make it more palatable for these drivers to take this aid in.  But the way to get to that, the real answer to this is to get to phase one of this ceasefire deal.  You get hostages home to their families.  You get six weeks of a sustainable calm that will allow the comfort level for aid organizations to increase to a degree where they can move freely about Gaza.  If you have a six-week ceasefire in place, then nobody is shooting at anybody, and it should be a lot easier to move humanitarian assistance.,MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Next up, we’ll go to Paris Wong.,Q    Hello.  Thank you, John.  I’m going to focus to Indo-Pacific region.  So, in an interview on Tuesday, Philippines ambassador to the U.S. said if there’s a conflict between Taiwan and China that would affect the Philippines, that it would most likely agree to the U.S. using its military bases in the defense of Taiwan.  So does the Biden administration welcome Philippines’ willingness to work with the U.S. on Taiwan safety? And also, does this mean the United States has successfully mobilized from North Asia to Southeast Asia, from Japan to Philippines, to form a security network in the Indo-Pacific?  Thank you.,MR. KIRBY:  I think you know I’m not going to get into hypotheticals or speculate about the conflict across the Taiwan Strait.  Nothing has changed about our One China policy.  We don’t want to see the status quo changed or altered unilaterally.  We certainly don’t want to see it changed or altered by force.,And everything the President has been doing — in our conversations with the PRC, in our work with allies like South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines — has been designed to prevent that outcome from happening.  And that’s what we’re focused on.,The Philippines is a treaty ally.  We take our alliance commitments seriously with the Philippines, as we have demonstrated certainly in recent weeks and months.  And it was terrific to have President Marcos here to participate in the first-ever trilat between the United States, Japan, and the Philippines when we were hosting Prime Minister Kishida for the state visit as well.,So, an awful lot of work has been done by President Biden and this team in terms of shoring up our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.  And the reason you do that is to make it clear that we don’t want to see a conflict, that we do have the capabilities in place to defend ourselves and defend our allies, and that there should be no reason for any of these tensions to erupt into conflict whatsoever.,MODERATOR:  Thanks, everyone.  That’s all the time we have for today.  If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to our team.  Thanks again.,11:09 A.M.

That includes helping 23 million families save on their monthly bills through our Affordable Connectivity Program. While Republicans in Congress have refused to help us revive this program, our Administration is refusing to let them stop us from delivering for families across America.,Today, I am proud to highlight that we are finalizing a rule to allow schools and libraries – primarily in low-income and rural areas – to use funding from the Federal Communications Commission’s E-Rate program for Wi-Fi hotspots that will increase access to remote learning and virtual library services. Additionally, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration will award over $9 million to the state of Nevada to implement their Digital Equity Plan. This is the first award issued under our Administration’s more than $1.4 billion State Digital Equity Capacity Grant Program, which will help millions of families receive the resources, skills, and opportunities they need to access internet that is fast, affordable, and reliable.,President Biden and I understand that this is essential in the 21st century – from ensuring our students can do their homework and that parents can find a good-paying job, to making sure our communities’ small business owners can use the internet to run their business.

They discussed ongoing U.S. efforts to support de-escalation and a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing hostilities in Lebanon that would ensure the return of both Israeli and Lebanese families to their homes in the border regions.

This is the second largest award to date through the American Rescue Plan’s Butch Lewis Act. This announcement brings the total number of pensions protected by the American Rescue Plan to over 1 million, including over 52,000 Pennsylvanians, 71,000 Illinoisans, 71,000 New Yorkers, 62,000 Ohioans, 61,000 Michiganders, 39,000 Missourians, 33,000 Wisconsinites and many more.,Today’s Announcement Protects the Earned Pensions of more than 103,000 Union Workers and Retirees from Devastating 45% cuts:,Prior to passage of the ARP, the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund was one of the largest financially distressed multiemployer pension plans in the nation. Workers in this plan include manufacturing, production, maintenance and sanitation workers in the baking and confectionery industries.,Without the historic support to protect workers’ pension benefits included in President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, these workers and retirees—who have already earned these benefits—would have faced estimated benefit reductions of roughly 45% by the end of the decade. Instead, thanks to ARP, the plan will now be projected to pay full benefits to workers and retirees through at least 2051.,Today Marks,Over One Million Workers and Retirees Protected,to Date Thanks to President Biden Including this Protection into the American Rescue Plan:,Administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the ARP’s Special Financial Assistance program—known as the “Butch Lewis Act” for the heroic Ohio union leader and pension advocate—will provided security for roughly 200 distressed multiemployer pension plans to ensure roughly 2 million workers’ pension plans remain solvent and will be able to pay the full benefits that workers have earned over the next several decades. These workers and their unions made the tough choice to take less wages in their working years to ensure that they could have the resources for a strong, dignified retirement. At no fault of their own, these workers on average faced devastating cuts—on average 37%—before the passage of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan.,With today’s announcement, the Biden Harris Administration has:,Through the Special Financial Assistance Program, ARP included the most significant effort to protect the solvency of the multiemployer pension system in almost 50 years.,Multiemployer plans are created through agreements between employers and a union, with plans typically involving multiple employers in a single industry or related industries. A typical worker whose multiemployer plan became insolvent would see their expected pension benefits slashed substantially. Before ARP, workers and retirees participating in more than 200 multiemployer pension plans faced the prospect of not receiving the full benefits they earned and need to support them and their families in retirement. These plans are insured by the PBGC, a federal agency which provides partial protection of the benefits of approximately 11.2 million workers and retirees in approximately 1,400 private-sector multiemployer, union-connected plans. Prior to the ARP, the PBGC’s multiemployer pension insurance program was itself projected to become insolvent in 2026. Thanks to the ARP, once-struggling multiemployer pension plans will be able pay the full benefits earned by workers and retirees who participate in these plans through at least 2051.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",21-06-24,FACT SHEET: Biden-⁠Harris Administration Announces Over One Million Pensions Protected Thanks to the American Rescue Plan,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-over-one-million-pensions-protected-thanks-to-the-american-rescue-plan/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Presidential Actions,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,1.  On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2253), the President issued Proclamation 9693, imposing a safeguard measure for a period of 4 years that included both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, provided for in subheading 8541.40.60 (currently 8541.42.00) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), and an increase in duties (safeguard tariff) on imports of CSPV cells exceeding the TRQ and all imports of other CSPV products, including modules provided for in subheading 8541.40.60 (currently 8541.43.00) of the HTS.  Proclamation 9693 exempted imports from certain designated beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences from the application of the safeguard measure.,2.  Clause (4) and Annex I of Proclamation 9693 directed the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to establish procedures for interested persons to request the exclusion of particular products from the safeguard measure.  Pursuant to the procedures that the USTR enacted, effective June 13, 2019, the USTR excluded bifacial solar panels that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the panel and that consist of only bifacial solar cells that absorb light and generate electricity on both sides of the cells (bifacial modules).  Exclusion of Particular Products From the Solar Products Safeguard Measure, 84 FR 27684 (June 13, 2019).,3.  After taking into account the United States International Trade Commission’s (USITC) report on the results of its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic solar industry (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products:  Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-201-075 (Monitoring)) and the USITC’s report regarding the probable economic effect on the domestic CSPV cell and module manufacturing industry of modifying the safeguard measure (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products:  Advice on the Probable Economic Effect of Certain Modifications to the Safeguard Measure, No. TA-201-075 (Modification)), and after receiving a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry with respect to each of the following modifications, on October 10, 2020, the President issued Proclamation 10101 under section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)).  In Proclamation 10101, the President determined that the domestic industry had begun to make a positive adjustment to import competition, as shown by the increases in domestic module production capacity, production, and market share.  Proclamation 10101 also:,(a)  revoked the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard measure on the basis that it had impaired and was likely to continue to impair the effectiveness of the safeguard action; and,(b)  adjusted the safeguard tariff for the fourth year of the safeguard measure from 15 percent to 18 percent on the basis that the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard tariff had impaired the remedial effectiveness of the 4-year action proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, and to achieve the full remedial effect envisaged in that action.,4.  On November 16, 2021, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) held in,Solar Energy Industries Association et al. v. United States,that the President acted outside of his statutory authority in issuing Proclamation 10101, and enjoined the Government from enforcing that proclamation.  However, in November 2023, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the CIT’s decision.,5.  After receiving the USITC’s December 8, 2021, determination and report pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), which found that the safeguard action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry and that there was evidence that the domestic industry was making a positive adjustment to import competition (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products, Investigation No. TA-201-75 (Extension)), and after taking into account the information provided in the USITC’s report and the information received from the public through the process published in the,Federal Register,on September 30, 2021 (86 FR 54279), pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)), I issued Proclamation 10339 on February 4, 2022.  In Proclamation 10339, I determined that the safeguard action on imports of CSPV cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products, continued to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and that there was evidence that the domestic industry was making a positive adjustment to import competition.  I further determined to extend the safeguard measure proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, as modified by Proclamation 10101, in relevant part, as follows:,(a)  continuation of the increase in duties on imports of modules described in paragraph 1 of Proclamation 10339 for an additional period of 4 years, with annual reductions in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as described in Annex I to Proclamation 10339; and,(b)  exclusion of bifacial panels from the extension of duties proclaimed in paragraph 9 of Proclamation 10339.,6.  If an extension of an action taken under section 203 of    the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253) exceeds 3 years, section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)) requires the USITC to issue a report to the President and the Congress on its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic industry, including the progress and specific efforts made by workers and firms in the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition, no later than the midpoint of the period of the extension.,7.  On February 6, 2024, the USITC issued its second midterm report pursuant to section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)) on its monitoring of developments within the industry producing CSPV products since the President’s imposition of the safeguard measure (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products:  Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-201-075 (Second Monitoring)).  In its report, the USITC found that the safeguard measure has resulted in positive adjustments from the domestic industry in light of increased actual and planned module production; various announcements of planned domestic cell production; and improvements in several of the domestic industry’s financial, trade, and employment indicators.  The USITC’s report also noted a shift in imports from non-bifacial CSPV cells and panels toward primarily bifacial CSPV cells and modules from 2020-2022 and, when comparing the first half of 2023 with the first half of 2022, with bifacial cells and panels increasingly used in traditionally non-bifacial applications.,8.  On February 23, 2024, a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry submitted a petition under section 204(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)) to modify the safeguard measure by revoking the exclusion of bifacial products from safeguard relief proclaimed in Proclamation 10339, thus subjecting bifacial modules to the remedy under section 201 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2251).  The petition explains how the domestic industry has continued to make a positive adjustment to import competition.  It also explains how the exclusion of bifacial panels has led to large import volumes of bifacial modules competing in all sectors of the United States market, thus negatively impacting the domestic industry’s efforts to increase substantially its market share notwithstanding the increase in apparent United States consumption.,9.  Section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)) authorizes the President, upon submission of a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry, to reduce, modify, or terminate an action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act when the President determines that the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition.,10.  After taking into account the information provided in the USITC’s second midterm report, and after receiving a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry with respect to the aforementioned modification, I have determined that the domestic industry has been making and is continuing to make a positive adjustment to import competition, shown by increased actual and planned module production; various announcements of planned domestic cell production; and improvements in several of the domestic industry’s financial, trade, and employment indicators.  Furthermore, I have determined that imports of bifacial panels have surged in recent years, such that the exclusion of bifacial panels proclaimed in Proclamation 10339 has impaired the effectiveness of the action taken in Proclamation 9693, as extended by Proclamation 10339, and that to achieve the full remedial effect envisaged for that action, it is necessary to modify the section 201 action by revoking the exclusion of bifacial panels and applying the safeguard tariff to bifacial panels.,NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including sections 203, 204, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:,(1)  In order to modify the action applicable to imports of CSPV cells under HTS subheading 8541.42.0010 and other CSPV products, such as modules under HTS subheading 8541.43.0010, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.,(2)  The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, including Annex I hereto, shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 5 days after the date of this proclamation, and shall continue in effect as provided in Annex I to this proclamation, unless such actions are earlier expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.,(3)  Bifacial panels that are subject to the modifications described in clause (1) of this proclamation shall be exempt from the safeguard tariff, provided that:,(i)    the imported bifacial panels are fulfilling in whole or in part a contract for sale, purchase, or delivery in the United States that was in effect and dated as executed prior to May 17, 2024, that provides for importation to or delivery within the United States within 90 days after the effective date of this proclamation, and that has not been modified on or later than May 17, 2024, with regard to importation or delivery date;,(ii)   the bifacial panels are entered into the United States within 90 days after the effective date of this proclamation;,(iii)  the bifacial panels are declared and entered under heading 9903.45.29 of the HTS, and meet the conditions thereof; and,(iv)   the importer completes the certification in Annex II to this proclamation and provides the completed certification as part of the importer’s electronic entry summary to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) by uploading it to the Document Imaging System in the Automated Commercial Environment at the time that classification is declared under heading 9903.45.29 of the HTS.,(4)  Where bifacial panels that are subject to the modifications described in clause (1) of this proclamation are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the effective date of this proclamation and do not satisfy the requirements specified in clause (3) of this proclamation, such bifacial panels shall be subject to the safeguard tariff.,(5)  CBP shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements in clauses (3) and (4) of this proclamation.  Such actions may include requiring the provision of any additional information deemed necessary by CBP, including a copy of the pre-existing contract described in subsection (i) of clause (3) of this proclamation, in order to verify such compliance.,(6)  One year from the termination of the safeguard measure referenced in this proclamation, as modified by this proclamation, the U.S. note and tariff provisions established in Annex I to this proclamation shall be deleted from the HTS.,(7)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.,IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.,JOSEPH R.

Thirty years ago, I wrote the Violence Against Women Act, and as President, I have strengthened the law and secured its highest-ever funding.

Taylor — the former President D. Taylor, I thank you.  I know you’re here somewhere.  (Applause.)  And I want to thank you for your friendship and decades of leadership in the labor movement.  And, of course, we all know, D.  I mean, your strength and determination has improved the lives of countless workers around our nation.  So, thank you, D.,And to President Gwen Mills — (applause) — congratulations on your historic election.  And I know, we all know, that she is going to continue this union’s long legacy of impact.,And finally, to the members of UNITE HERE, I thank you for everything you do for our nation and for your unwavering support of President Biden and me.,You know, in 2020, in states like Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona, it was you — it was the members of this union who energized, who organized, and mobilized.  It is because of your work and your support that Joe Biden is President of the United States and I am the first woman elected Vice President of the United States.  (Applause.)  I’m really clear about how we got here.,And so, you know, many of you know a bit about my background.  You know that my parents met while they were active in the Civil Rights Movement.  And so, when I was young, they would take me to marches in a stroller.  And from a very young age, then, I learned that when people stand together, when we use our collective voice, when we stand in solidarity, we can drive extraordinary change, because it is we who stand together as the collective who have the power and the ability to see what can be, unburdened by what has been.,And my entire career, like everyone here, I have been guided by a fundamental belief, then, in the power of the collective — a belief that has also, of course, guided the work of UNITE HERE from its earliest days.,So, for the press in the room, I’ll give you a little history lesson.  More than a hundred years ago, in Lawrence, Massachusetts, tens of thousands of textile workers — many of them women — came together to demand fair pay and safer working conditions.,For months, in the cold New England winter, they stood together — workers of all backgrounds, including immigrants from Italy and Poland and Germany and dozens of other countries; many who did not speak English, but spoke the language of solidarity as they stood shoulder to shoulder.  And all — (applause) — of course, all that is true today.,And that legacy is strong.  And together, then, a hundred years ago, they fought.  And together, they won.,And in the decades since, the workers of UNITE HERE have taken on some of the most powerful corporations in our nation, from Big Pharma to the hedge funds, which took over casinos and put profits over workers.  And you have won — you’ve won fair pay, better benefits, safer working conditions, and protection against discrimination and harassment.,Through the power of the collective, you have transformed millions of jobs into middle-class jobs — jobs that come with the dignity that all people deserve.  (Applause.),And I know of your work.  For many years, I have had the honor to work closely with the leaders of this union.  When I was Attorney General of California, I worked with j- — with you, with many of the leaders here to crack down on wage theft.  As a United States senator, we fought together for paid family leave and medical leave for more workers.  (Applause.),And as Elena mentioned, this past October, with pride, I stood in Las Vegas with the workers of Culinary 226 for your Day of Action — (applause) — (laughs) — ohh — for your Day of Action — (applause) —,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  226!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and again — 226! — (laughs) —,AUDIENCE:  226!  226!  226!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And again, in Las Vegas, a few months later, it was my honor to join Culinary —,AUDIENCE:  226!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — once again — (laughs) — to celebrate your contract win.  And, my goodness, what a historic contract win: your historic pay raise of 32 percent.  Extraordinary.  Extraordinary.  (Applause.),And, of course, this was a victory for all workers — for all workers — because, as we in this room know, when union wages go up, everyone’s wages go up.  (Applause.)  When union workplaces are more safe, all workplaces are more safe.  When unions are strong, America is strong.  (Applause.),And President Joe Biden and I are proud to stand by your side.  (Applause.),So, together — together, we have fought for affordable healthcare, knowing healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.  (Applause.),We, together — together, we took on Big Pharma and capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for our seniors.  (Applause.)  And now, because of our work together, three of the largest drug companies in the country are capping the cost of asthma inhalers from hundreds of dollars each to just $35 each.  (Applause.),And we know how that affects so many of our babies, historically, and how expensive those inhalers have been.,And we are finally making it so that medical debt can no longer count against your credit score — (applause) — which means medical debt can no longer get in the way of someone’s ability to get a car loan, to get a home loan, to get a lease for an apartment.  (Applause.),Because I don’t need to tell anyone here, medical debt — well, most people come by medical debt because of a medical emergency.  They didn’t ask for it.  They didn’t save for it.  And it happens, and then they’re out tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  And the way it has been working is it can count against somebody’s credit score.,Well, your credit score is supposed to be a measure of whether you are financially responsible.  It doesn’t make any sense that you would cause somebody to take a hit to their credit score for a medical emergency, and that’s why we’re getting rid of that.  (Applause.),In addition to medical debt, we are also addressing the issue of student loan debt.  (Applause.)  So far, we have forgiven student loan debt for nearly 5 million Americans and twice as much for our public servants, including our teachers, our nurses, and firefighters.  (Applause.),So, UNITE HERE, I stand here as we are 137 days away from the most important election of our lifetime.  And there is a very clear contrast between who we have looked out for and who the last administration looked out for.,Whereas the last administration gave tax cuts to billionaires —,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we gave tax cuts to families with children through the Child Tax Credit — (applause) — and cut the rate of child poverty in half when we did it.  (Applause.),We are also proud to lead the most pro-union administration in the history of America.  (Applause.)  We expanded the power of OSHA to make workplaces safer.  (Applause.),As head of the White House Labor Task Force, I have led our work to eliminate barriers to organizing in both public and private sectors.  (Applause.),And we did the long overdue work to protect the pension plans of now more than 1 million union workers — (applause) — including thousands of UNITE HERE members and retirees.,On the issue of immigration, we believe in keeping families together, not tearing them apart.  (Applause.)  So, now, undocumented spouses of American citizens who have been in the country for 10 or more years can stay in the country while they apply for a green card — (applause) — and so can their children.  (Applause.),We also made it easier for thousands of DREAMers who have graduated college to secure work permits, because our entire nation benefits from their extraordinary skill, talent, and ambition.  (Applause.),So, the bottom line is that in all we do, President Biden and I are guided by the belief that we work for you and we will fight with you, alongside you, and for you.,On the other hand, Donald Trump has made it clear time and time again —,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — he only cares about himself.  He openly talks about his intention to weaponize the Department of Justice against his enemies.  He openly talks about his admiration for dictators.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Has vowed on day one that he will be a dictator on day one.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  He said he is — and I’m going to quote — “proudly responsible” for overturning Roe v.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,President Biden is delivering on the most ambitious climate and conservation agenda in history, including by already protecting more than 41 million acres of lands and waters. Today the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new steps to conserve, restore, and expand our nation’s old growth forests by advancing a proposal from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s Forest Service to amend all 128 forest land management plans to better steward old-growth forests across the entire National Forest System.,America’s forests are a key climate solution, absorbing carbon dioxide equivalent to more than 10 percent of U.S. annual greenhouse gas emissions.,USDA’s National Forest Plan Amendment,proposes a consistent framework to guide conservation and restoration of old-growth forest conditions across all national forests. This framework will also help to ensure that our nation’s forests remain resilient to increasing threats from climate change.,The proposed amendment will use the best available science, including Indigenous Knowledge, to drive management strategies that conserve, restore, and cultivate old-growth forest conditions across our national forests. The preferred alternative outlined in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement released today sets protections for existing old growth, outlines proactive stewardship and science-based management steps to reduce the threat of old-growth mortality from catastrophic wildfire, and would require a locally-informed adaptive management strategy to be developed within two years of a final decision.,The Forest Service and the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) together manage approximately 32 million acres of old-growth and 80 million acres of mature forests on federal lands,,for a total of 112 million acres,. Old-growth forests represent 18 percent and mature forest another 45 percent of all forested land managed by the two agencies. Next week Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta will share today’s progress with the world and speak about the role that forests play in combatting the climate crisis at the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum in Norway.,President Biden’s,Executive Order on Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies,and the,Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government approach,are furthering efforts to safeguard and steward our nation’s forests, including through $50 million from the Inflation Reduction Act and the President’s Investing in America agenda to support old-growth conservation.,Other recent progress to conserve and restore our nation’s forests and expand access to outdoor space for communities include:,Mature and Old-Growth Threats Analysis:,Last week the Forest Service issued a final,Mature and Old Growth Threats Analysis,which identified wildfire, exacerbated by climate change and fire exclusion, as the leading threat to mature and old-growth forests. This was followed by insects and disease in the West, while more varied disturbances threaten older forests in Alaska and in eastern regions. The analysis also found that two-thirds of mature forests and just over half of old-growth forests are vulnerable to these threats. Tree cutting (any removal of trees) is currently a relatively minor threat despite having been a major disturbance historically, as from 1950 to 1990 these practices were the primary reason for loss of old-growth forests. The threats analysis suggests that current land management activities may not be sufficiently responsive to rapidly changing disturbances and conditions that affect mature and old-growth forest conditions, showing the need for an updated nationwide plan.,Interim Forest Service Project Review:,To ensure consistency in old-growth management as the nationwide plan amendment process progresses, last December the Forest Service issued an interim policy outlined in more detail in a,letter,from the deputy chief of the National Forest System to regional foresters. Under the interim policy the deputy chief of the Forest Service has reviewed over 90 projects to ensure consistency with the proposed action. Additional projects are pending review.,Showcasing Forest Conservation Projects:,The Biden-Harris Administration released a beta version of the,American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas,, an innovative tool that offers users the ability to view a wide range of scientific information, data, and knowledge on biodiversity, climate change impacts, and equity, with the goal of helping inform and inspire land, water, and wildlife conservation and restoration efforts of individuals, land managers, policymakers, and communities. The Atlas showcases investments in forest health, urban and community forestry grant projects, and other resilience and restoration investments.,BLM Public Lands Rule:,In April, the BLM finalized the,Public Lands Rule,to help guide the balanced management of America’s public lands and steward healthy landscapes. The final rule supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to ensure forests continue to deliver clean water, clean air, and sustainable wildlife habitat.,Urban and Community Forestry Inflation Reduction Act Grants:,With urban forests making up 20 percent of all forests in the United States, urban trees are essential to helping communities access nature and reducing the impacts of climate change.,USDA’s Urban and Community Forestry Program,is the only federal program dedicated to the nation’s urban forest resources, reaching more than 140 million acres of urban and community forests across the United States. Through funding from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, nearly $1.4 billion has been awarded to support urban tree-planting and management in communities across the country.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",20-06-24,FACT SHEET: Biden-⁠Harris Administration Proposes Plan to Protect and Steward Old-Growth Forests on National Forest System Lands,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-proposes-plan-to-protect-and-steward-old-growth-forests-on-national-forest-system-lands/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Like so many others in my neighborhood and around the country, when I played Little League, I wanted to play centerfield because of Willie Mays. It was a rite of passage to practice his basket catches, daring steals, and command at the plate – only to be told by coaches to cut it out because no one can do what Willie Mays could do.,He was an original in so many ways.,His Hall of Fame career in Birmingham, New York, and San Francisco speaks for itself. Spanning three decades, his final box score was 660 homeruns, 3,293 hits, .301 batting average, 12 Gold Gloves, the 1954 World Series Championship, and questions of how many records he could’ve set had he not been drafted into the Army during the Korean War after winning the National League Rookie of the Year award.,He was also an original in perhaps the most important of ways.,Born and raised in Jim Crow-era Alabama, he was part of the initial wave of Black players from the Negro Leagues to integrate Major League Baseball. With his distinct style of play – in constant motion, with individual freedom, with power and grace – the world stopped to watch him play. He not only entertained, above all, he inspired millions of people of all races to help break through the color line of sports, and to break through the conscience of the Nation.,He passed away last night and today the Nation marks Juneteenth, a day of profound weight and power that reminds ourselves of the extraordinary capacity to emerge from the most painful moments with a better version of ourselves.,On this day, we remember Willie Mays as part of the long-line of Black patriots who have helped us see a better version of ourselves as Americans and as a Nation.,Jill and I send our love to the Mays family, his adoring fans, and all those he will continue to inspire with his one-of-a-kind legacy.,May God bless, Willie Mays.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",19-06-24,Statement from President Joe Biden on the Passing of Willie Mays,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/19/statement-from-president-joe-bidenon-the-passing-of-willie-mays/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Tomb Field, New York,Good morning.,I must admit that it is daunting to stand in front of a sign that says “Acta Non Verba” – deeds not words – and then come up here and offer you a bunch of words. But I will do my best.,Vice Admiral Nunan.,Deputy Secretary Trottenberg.,General Smith.,Rear Admiral Phillips.,Congressman Souzzi.,Friends, family, and faculty.,And most importantly, the midshipmen of the Class of 2024.,Congratulations!,It is an honor be here with the newest generation of Kings Pointers.,I did not time that flyover, but I’ll take it.,To be honest, being your Commencement Speaker is a daunting task.,What can I say about duty – to a class that’s already crewed 167 ships around the world?,What can I say about determination – to a class that’s won the Secretaries’ Cup against Coast Guard for the 5th time in a row?,What can I say about boldness – to a class that convinced their Superintendent to let them wear Choker Whites in the middle of December?,You have much to be proud of.,And the path you’ve chosen is a tremendously honorable one.,As soon-to-be ensigns and second lieutenants, assistant engineers and third mates – you will crew ships that are essential to our nation’s security.,And you’ll spend a large part of your life at sea, so your fellow Americans can live safely at home.,You’ve come so far – and you have so many great things ahead – thanks in large part to the people who’ve always been right behind you, and are right behind you today. Your parents and grandparents, your brothers and sisters, and everyone who loves and believes in you.,So before I go any further, let’s give them a huge round of applause.,Now, as the President’s National Security Advisor, I see the impact of the U.S. Merchant Marine every single day.,In the Atlantic, you’re making sure that ammunition reaches Ukrainian soldiers fighting for their freedom.,In the Pacific, you’re deterring aggression and upholding freedom of navigation.,In the Red Sea – as Admiral Nunan and Administrator Phillips referenced – you’re facing down unprecedented attacks against international trade in one of the most vital waterways in the world.,At ports, on decks, and in engine rooms around the globe, the “blue and grey” help keep our people safe and our country strong.,And in return, we owe it to you to keep the Merchant Marine strong.,And that’s why President Biden is taking historic steps to spur investment in ships made in American shipyards, built with American supplies, and crewed by American mariners.,We’re working with labor unions to investigate actions by China that may unfairly undercut our shipbuilding and maritime industries.,And we are committed to building America’s fleet of the future – from undersea construction vessels to warships to icebreakers – leveraging our nation’s unparalleled innovation and the unparalleled skill of our workforce.,I know – and the President knows – how critical American sea power will be in the years ahead.,And you know, the work you do is challenging, and will be challenging.,Those ships will take you far from your family.,Those tankers and transports will bring you to distant, often dangerous places.,You’ll face high winds, bad storms, and rough waters.,But you made it to this Academy because you showed toughness and talent.,And now you’ve made it through this Academy because you proved you have what it takes.,You’ve spent months underway, earning your “sea legs” and completing your “sea projects.”,You’ve dealt with blackouts, malfunctions, even fires – giving a whole new meaning to your class motto, “Light after Darkness.”,You braved the cold waters of Long Island Sound during rescue survival in February.  Some of you went the extra mile and earned your “Blue Nose Certificate” in the Arctic.,And all of you studied hard to earn your Coast Guard license, so you could ring the bell and attend June Ball.,I’m told that there are those of you may have had a bit too much fun at the Ball last night. And others may have gotten a bit rowdy at BHT and Benny’s over the years.,So I made a point of speaking with President Biden before coming here today.,And he wanted me to let you know – in keeping with the long-standing tradition as Commander-in-Chief – that he is hereby waiving the infractions of all midshipmen “stuck” or “on restriction” for minor conduct violations.,I’ll let your Superintendent clarify what “minor” means.,Looking ahead, all of you will be leaders. And people often speak about leadership in absolute terms.,They say, it’s about confidence. Or vision. Or results. And it is about those things.,But that’s the Wikipedia summary.  As the nation’s future leaders, you’ve got to read the book.  And I suspect you’ve already begun to see that leadership is not about clinging to a singular attribute. It’s about cultivating equal and opposite attributes, and learning how to put that tension to use. Holding seemingly opposite ideas in your head, and still finding clarity and purpose.,For example, to be a good leader, you need to be high-ego and low-ego.,Patient and impatient.,Focused on the big picture and the small details.,Holding fast to your convictions, and staying open to new ideas and new arguments.,Let me take a few minutes to explain what I mean.,First: you have to be both high-ego and low-ego.,Believe in yourself. You matter. Speak up. Take yourself seriously. Raise your hand for big assignments, which all of you have already done. Fight for your ideas. No one is going to advocate for you if you do not advocate for yourself.,But also – know that there are so many things are more important than you. Like your crew. Your shipmates. Your country.,To do right by them, you’ll need to put others ahead of yourself. Sometimes get behind someone else’s plan, when it’s the better way. Compromise.,In the White House Situation Room, I sit at the head of a table that brings together the President’s national security cabinet, including the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of National Intelligence. It’s my responsibility to set the agenda – not to dominate the conversation and make everyone listen to me, but to guide the discussion so that, as a team, we deliver for the President the best counsel on the toughest issues imaginable.,In your careers, have the confidence to sit at the tables where the decisions are made. And have the humility to recognize that other people’s contributions are as valuable as your own – sometimes more valuable.,The best people I work with know how to balance these dueling impulses. They never fail to shine. But they are – to the bone – team players. Always humble.  Always ready to champion someone else. Always ready to pitch in, and get the job done.,Be like them. Know your value, but see other people’s value, too.,Second: be impatient, and also patient.,Don’t wait for change – make change as fast as you possibly can. You’ve got to seize every moment. Set bold goals – and achieve them with relentless urgency and drive.,But also – be patient.,When I was in my 20s – couple years older than you guys are now – I randomly sat next to Joe Nye, the great foreign policy thinker, on an airplane. We got to talking, and he could tell I was a young person in a bit of a hurry. And he said, “Everything doesn’t have to happen tomorrow. You have time to make mistakes, time to explore, time for trial and error. You don’t always need to be in a rush.”,Now that I’m older, I can attest to how right he was.,He wasn’t saying, let life pass you by.  He was saying – see things through. Plant seeds and let them grow. Cultivate them. Wait for the right moment to harvest. It’s worth it — to take the time to figure things out and get them right.,All of you guys are going to be out there on missions – some of you already have – where speed and urgency are the name of the game. Where you’re in a crisis, every minute counts. But even then, you’ll handle those moments better if you’ve patiently prepared for them, as this Academy has taught you to do.,And good leaders master another kind of patience, too – patience in how they deal with other people.,You’re about to hold high-stakes jobs. Take it from me: those jobs can spend your patience down fast. After years of being easy-going, you can become quick to frustration. Not your best self.,When that happens, you’ve got to find a way to replenish.For me, that means taking long walks with my wife Maggie, some Tim McGraw, some ESPN, some time with friends.  Find what works for you. It takes discipline to be patient in jobs that rapidly drain the patience out of you.,You do not want to get into a place in your career that you’ve always dreamed of, and realize that somehow you became a jerk along the way. The people in your life deserve your grace. And that’s something that you have to work at.,Third: You got to focus on the big picture, and also sweat the details.,Every day, I hold a meeting on Ukraine, in my office in the West Wing where I bring together the military, economic, and diplomatic experts from across the staff of the National Security Council.,We never lose sight of the ultimate strategic objective – that Ukraine prevails, that Russia’s invasion fails, that NATO remains unified. We never take our eye off that ball.,And, for those who are willing to give it up for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity I think that deserves a round of applause as well.,But every day in that meeting – in excruciating detail – we go through Ukraine’s monthly supply of 155 ammunition – much of which is being delivered by the Merchant Marine.,We discuss how many Patriot interceptors they’re getting, how many auto transformers to help rebuild their energy grid after it gets hit by Russian missile strikes.,We talk about how to make sure the weapons are actually getting to the front-lines – because those aren’t just details to the people fighting in the trenches. That’s a matter of life and death.,Now if you’re grinding it out every day on ammunition supplies and not connecting it to the larger strategy, you won’t succeed.,But if you’re just sitting around talking about the larger strategy and not giving any thought to the ammunition, you also won’t succeed.,Never assume someone else has crushed the details. You’ve got to crush the details. You got to see the forest, but you also have to care about the trees.,And fourth: Hold fast to your convictions. And also, be open to changing your mind.,The lessons we learn through our faith, our families, our teachers – including here at the Academy – comprise the compass that guides us through life.,If you stay true to your deepest-held values – if you refuse to betray what you know to be right – you can always hold your head high. And you can always go home to your family and tell them, I made you proud.,But your bedrock principles are just that – a bedrock.  They only tell you so much about how to solve the particular problem in front of you.  Staying true to your beliefs does not mean closing your mind to different ways of solving that problem.,If you rarely update your thinking – even when you learn new information, or hear a compelling alternative case – that’s a strong indication that you’ve stopped learning. Stopped listening. And that’s something to correct fast.,Your ability to lead will depend on whether you can hear new evidence, new arguments, new ideas, and take them seriously.,This just doesn’t happen enough in the places where important decisions are made. A lot of people see refusing to budge as conviction and strength. But often, it’s just stubbornness and ego. Real strength lies in being able to say, “You know what, I learned something new, and it made me change my mind.”,Think about it. What are the odds that you’re just right all of the time? A lot of people may assert that, but what are the odds?,Not high. In his best year – sorry to make a Boston Red Sox reference – Ted Williams got a hit 4 times out of 10. The ultimate Hall of Famer. Let’s say you’re twice as good as that. That means that 2 times out of 10, your first swing at a problem doesn’t connect. You didn’t get it right. You can’t be paralyzed by that fact, but you should account for it.,So talk to people who disagree with you. Acknowledge the strength of their arguments. Acknowledge the weak spots in your arguments. Thinking through hard problems is not a zero-sum game. It’s a team sport.,This is one of many things I admire about working for President Biden. He gathers his staff almost every day in the Oval Office, grilling us kindly but mercilessly on every detail of a policy. And if he senses that someone in the room is biting their tongue, he never fails to say, “Don’t hold back. I want to hear your concern. What is wrong with the course that we are on?”,It’s a rare leader who invites dissenting views, much less in the Oval Office. But that’s the right disposition – not just for leaders but for everyone.,It’s never been easier than it is today to live in an echo chamber, only listening to those who agree with us and reflect our worldviews back to us.,But that represents the end of personal growth… and in many ways, it risks the end of progress for our nation.,Don’t compromise on your core values – but do build a practice of adjusting and sharpening your point of view.,Members of the Class of 2024 – what I’ve described here adds up to a habit of the mind.,Holding competing thoughts in your head at the same time. Balancing them with purpose. And putting them to effective use.,And from complexity, finding clarity.,I’ve named a few examples of this, but there are many more. And you will see them in your careers, and I see them in my job every day.,The United States must compete vigorously with geopolitical rivals and the United States must cooperate with partners to solve the great challenges of our time.,We can support Israel’s right to self-defense and the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and dignity.,We can stand with Ukraine in its fight against tyranny and deter and prevent World War III.,We can stand up to China, and we can engage in responsible diplomacy with China.,Now some of those positions won’t make for a great soundbite or satisfy a certain class of D.C. pundit. But they’re what I believe. They’re what the President believes. And they represent America at our best in the world – strong, commonsense, intelligent, and unafraid.,Graduates: you will be leaders at a pivotal time. America is counting on you to do your duties – as you have done in your years at Kings Point – with honor, with integrity, and with skill. I can’t promise it will always be “fair winds and following seas.”,But I can promise it will be a life of consequential work. And after the exceptional training you’ve received at this Academy, you are more than ready for what awaits you.

From record-high average temperatures and extreme heat to changing precipitation patterns and sea-level rise, climate impacts – including disasters made worse by climate change – are affecting every corner of society and every community in America. The magnitude of challenges posed by the climate crisis was underscored last year when the nation endured a record 28 individual billion-dollar extreme weather and climate disasters that caused more than $90 billion in aggregate damage. Just this week, more than 82 million Americans have been under heat alerts due to extreme temperatures made worse by climate change. That is why President Biden is leading the most ambitious climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in history, which includes directing federal agencies to lead by example.,Today, the Biden-Harris Administration released updated,Climate Adaptation Plans developed by more than 20 federal agencies,that expand agency efforts to ensure their facilities, employees, resources, and operations are increasingly resilient to climate change impacts like extreme weather. This work advances the Biden-Harris Administration’s,National Climate Resilience Framework,, which helps to align climate resilience investments across the public and private sector through common principles and opportunities for action to build a climate-resilient nation. These efforts are backed by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, through which more than $50 billion is being delivered to advance climate adaptation and resilience across the nation, including in communities that are the most vulnerable to climate impacts.,At the beginning of his Administration, President Biden tasked agencies with leading a whole-of-government effort to address climate change through Executive Order 14008,,Tackling the Climate Cris,i,s at Home and Abroad,. Federal agencies,released initial Climate Adaptation Plans in 2021,and progress reports outlining advancements toward achieving their adaptation goals,in 2022,. With more than 300,000 buildings, four million employees, 640 million acres of public land, and $700 billion in annual purchases of goods and services, the federal government must continue to be a leader and partner in advancing adaptation and resilience.,In coordination with the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agencies updated their Climate Adaptation Plans for 2024 to 2027 to better integrate climate risk across their mission, operations, and asset management, including:,Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is making available more than 20 updated Climate Adaptation Plans from major federal agencies.

A historic number of people, now more than 120 million, have been forced from their homes by war, violence, and persecution. Many of them left behind everything, fleeing with their families because of a fear of violence, ethnic oppression, political or religious persecution, or other forms of hatred and intolerance.,On this day, we reaffirm our solidarity with refugees. We also express our profound appreciation for the United Nations and the many humanitarian organizations and workers who provide refugees with life-saving assistance. We recognize the special challenges faced by countries hosting large numbers of refugees and applaud governments that have welcomed refugees and given them opportunities to integrate into and contribute to local communities.,The United States is proud to be a global leader in responding to the needs of refugees and displaced people worldwide. We are the largest donor of humanitarian assistance globally, providing those in need with life-saving food, water, shelter, and medical care. Our commitment to refugee protection extends to doing more to address the root causes of displacement, including to resolve conflicts and oppression in troubled parts of the world. This Administration has also led an historic expansion of lawful pathways so migrants do not put themselves and their families at grave risk undertaking perilous journeys.,Here at home, my Administration has rebuilt the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, strengthened our extensive refugee vetting processes, and expanded access to resettlement to the most vulnerable around the world. In Fiscal Year 2024, we are on track to resettle more than 100,000 refugees in the United States, the most in three decades. Refugees make significant political, social, and economic contributions that enrich American communities. Refugees and asylees contributed almost $124 billion to our nation’s economy from 2005 to 2019.  Last year, to expand opportunities for Americans to more directly help refugees, the United States launched the,Welcome Corps,, an initiative that builds upon our country’s long tradition of providing refuge to people forced to flee their homes in search of safety and freedom through sponsorship.,Despite our achievements resettling refugees at home and protecting them overseas, we have much left to do. Together with our partners, we must work toward a world where people are safe from persecution and war, and where all people feel welcome and integrated into their communities.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",20-06-24,Statement from President Joe Biden on World Refugee Day,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/20/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-world-refugee-day-2/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several state leaders highlighted how they have used funds from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan as a key source for building and expanding community college promise programs.,Officials from the Domestic Policy Council and Office of the First Lady spoke to the Administration’s commitment to expanding access to free community college. Community colleges are the nation’s largest provider of workforce training, and the Administration has centered community colleges in federal efforts to prepare workers for the jobs of today and tomorrow. This includes both the President’s,$90 billion proposal,in his budget to expand free community college nationwide, which would save eligible students an estimated $4,500 or more per year, and the Classroom to Career proposal, which would provide high school students access to 12 free career-related community college credits through dual enrollment.,State participants included:,Administration participants included:,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",21-06-24,Readout of White House Meeting on Expanding Access to Free Community College,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/21/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-expanding-access-to-free-community-college/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Hosted by the Urban Institute and the Consumer Federation of America,As Prepared for Delivery,Thank you all for the important work you do on behalf of American consumers every day.,President Biden sees our economy through the eyes of middle-class families like the ones he grew up with in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He knows that a lot of families are feeling squeezed by the cost of living. That’s why the President’s top economic priority is lowering costs.,The President has directed his Administration to use every available tool to lower costs for families in each important area of their budgets. We have more work to do, but this plan is already putting thousands of dollars back in many families’ pockets on everything from insulin, to inhalers, to home heating, to credit card fees, to lower gas prices,.,That may not sound like much to the wealthy, but those savings add up for hardworking Americans.  And the President is fighting to extend these savings to more Americans who stand to save thousands of dollars more each year.,The question now is: Do we want to continue fighting to build an economy that gives families more breathing room by lowering costs? Or do we want an economy that gives big corporations and the ultra-wealthy special breaks and raises costs for everyone else?,Many Republicans in Congress take every opportunity to call attention to inflation, but they haven’t offered a single solution to bring costs down. Instead, they want to take us backwards—including by imposing broad tariffs on all imports that would raise families’ costs by thousands of dollars per year.,The President has a comprehensive plan to continue lowering costs across the economy, from groceries and gas to healthcare and housing to transportation and ticketing. Today, we are sharing a summary of these actions that shows in detail the cost savings in every area of the family budget from the President’s initiatives. I want to spend a few minutes talking about what’s at stake in this debate—and some of the core pillars of the President’s lowering costs agenda.,Why Did Prices Increase,?,We know from the data that the pandemic drove the rise in inflation that has squeezed Americans over the past few years.  In fact, every country saw a similar surge in inflation as a result of the global economy shutting down and supply chains breaking. The surge in inflation was exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused a sharp increase in gasoline and food prices.,The President took action in partnership with the private sector to address supply chain bottlenecks and mitigate the impact of these disruptions. Today, supply chains are largely back to normal, and inflation has fallen by about two-thirds, and some areas, input costs have come down. Yet some companies have been slow in passing these savings on to consumers.,I have talked about a price-price spiral where companies capitalize on their pricing power to expand their margins when input prices go up. Now, we are seeing some companies with pricing power keep their margins high rather than pass along savings to consumers when input prices go down.,In fact, 2023 saw the highest after-tax profit rate for corporations outside of the financial sector since at least 1947.,Although we are beginning to see some signs of price reductions, there is room for further disinflation as margins compress further.,Where pricing power is high, in some industries, it reflects weak market competition. When competitive pressures are strong, businesses must pass along cost savings to consumers in order to keep or win their business. The evidence suggests,three quarters of U.S. industries grew more concentrated,in the decades before President Biden took office, which may have contributed to weaker price competition in some sectors. That is why the President’s efforts to lower costs for families have gone hand in hand with his actions to strengthen market competition.,Bringing Grocery Costs Down,The President is focused on lowering the costs that are most important to families, like groceries, which Americans purchase every week. Grocery prices rose during the pandemic as deliveries piled up at ports, and,increased another 11.8 percent in 2022,due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which spiked food commodity prices. We worked with farmers, grocery stores and shippers to improve supply chains and restore global grain markets.,But even though shipping costs and global food commodity prices have declined sharply, grocery prices have been slow to come down, and grocery store margins remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.,President Biden has called on large grocery chains to pass along their savings to consumers and used his State of the Union Address to spotlight the high prices set by many packaged food companies.,Some grocery stores are answering the President’s call and lowering prices on thousands of items, and we are seeing signs that grocery prices may be turning a corner. Grocery prices have been,down,for each of the past 4 months, and,have increased only 1%,over the past year. In fact, prices are,down,over the past year for categories like fish and seafood, dairy products, and fresh fruit.,This is a start, but corporations have to do more to bring their prices down, and the President will keep up the pressure on this issue.,For low-income families that are struggling to pay grocery bills, the Administration has provided $2,000 more for groceries for a family of four by,improving SNAP,—lifting 3 million people out of poverty—and,launching Summer EBT,grocery assistance for nearly 21 million children.,And yet against this backdrop, some Congressional Republicans actually support putting tariffs on all food imports—raising prices by 10 percent on everyday purchases like coffee, chocolate, berries, fish, bananas and grapes.,Bringing Health Care Costs and Drug Prices Down,The President has also been fighting to bring down health care costs.,Americans pay,two to three times more,than people in other countries for the same prescription drugs. So it was a big victory for the American people when President Biden secured passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that has brought down the price of insulin to $35 a month for,seniors on Medicare,—saving some as much as $365 per month—and got the,three largest insulin producers,to cap insulin prices for other Americans. And the President has proposed making these savings available for the millions of younger Americans that use insulin.,Starting next year, as a result of this law, out of pocket prescription drug costs will also be,capped at $2,000 for seniors,—saving 19 million people $400 per year on average—and many thousands of dollars a year for some. And the President is fighting to extend this cap for all Americans.,Finally, thanks to the IRA, for the first time ever, Medicare is able to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs,,starting with 10 this year,and far more in the years to come. The President is fighting to extend these benefits to even more drugs.,I want to be clear: this doesn’t just help family budgets—it helps the federal budget too by lowering the deficit by,$160 billion over the next ten years,. Here again, Congressional Republicans opposed these drug price reductions—even though they reduce deficits, which means that, if they prevailed, they would raise the cost of,prescription drugs and insulin for tens of millions of Americans,.,And it is not only drug prices. The President’s health insurance premium tax credits enacted in the American Rescue Plan and extended by the IRA are saving millions of Americans an average of about $800 per year on,their health care premiums,. Republicans in Congress uniformly voted against this law and are working to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would raise health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.,In addition, in response to administrative actions, some of the largest inhaler producers have given eligible Americans access to inhalers costing,$35 a month—saving around $1,200 per year,—and the Biden Administration enacted rules that can help millions of Americans save as much as,$3,000 on their hearing aids,.,The President will continue to use every tool he has to lower health care costs.,Bringing Transportation Costs Down,As we enter the summer travel season, prices at the pump are perhaps the most visible price that Americans see every week.  National average gas prices are,below $3.50,amid continued record high domestic production.,This isn’t an accident. When gas prices spiked globally after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the President took extraordinary action to bring gas prices down. And additional actions by the Administration are helping to keep gas prices in this lower range today. We are in the process of releasing 1 million barrels of gas from the,Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve,, in time for the July 4,th,holiday.,The President believes consumers should have choices about what type of vehicle they want to drive. Thanks to Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, we are lowering the price of a,new clean vehicle by up to $7,500, and a used clean vehicle by up to $4,000,.  These clean vehicles are projected to lower fuel costs by an average of $700 a year and maintenance costs by $500 per year. For the first time ever, these tax credits are available up front at the dealer, as “cash on the hood.” We’ve seen strong uptake of this provision, with,$1 billion in upfront consumer savings in the first five months of 2024,across more than 150,000 clean vehicle sales.,In addition, we are lowering the costs of flights for many Americans. In signing the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act, the President delivered on his commitment to address family seating fees that are costly and frustrating for many families with young children.  Eliminating family seating fees can save a,family with two children $200 for a round trip itinerary,. And this law also provides passengers with,the right,to,automatic cash refunds,for cancelled or delayed flights and lost luggage.,Bringing Housing and Utility Costs Down,The President knows that housing costs are a critical part of every family’s budget. He has a comprehensive plan to lower housing costs for families. He has called on Congress to,bring rent down by funding the construction,of 2 million affordable homes, and to provide mortgage relief of up to $10,000 for millions of first-time homebuyers and homeowners seeking to trade up or downsize.,Congress should move on that proposal immediately. A bipartisan bill that would provide tax credits on the construction,of 200,000 additional affordable,units passed the House overwhelmingly in January, but is opposed by some Senate Republicans. Instead, some Congressional Republicans seem intent on protecting special tax breaks for corporate landlords and reducing rental assistance programs.,We urge Congress to act, but we cannot simply wait. We recently announced,a cap on annual rent increases,for the 2 million households in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit units, reducing the maximum that landlords can increase rent by an average of about,$480 annually,. We are going after rental junk fees that aren’t disclosed up front and that can add hundreds of extra dollars on top of rent every month.,Already, nearly,700,000 homeowners are saving roughly $900 annually,as a result of the Administration’s reduction in mortgage interest premiums for FHA-backed loans.,A title insurance pilot,could soon save thousands of Americans an average of $750 when they refinance their homes.,In addition, the President has signed historic legislation that helps families save on their utility bills. Thanks to the IRA, households that install a heat pump,receive a $2,000 tax credit and save $500 each year,on energy bills. Households that install energy efficient doors, windows and insulation,can save up to $1,200 per year,in tax credits.,Moreover, under the Affordable Connectivity Plan,,23 million families,have been able to save approximately $360 each year on highspeed internet and the President is fighting hard to keep this program in place.,Fighting to Lower the Cost of Living,The Biden Administration is taking action in numerous other areas where Americans are facing high costs—from banking overdraft fees and credit card late fees to filing taxes and attending live events.,On childcare, the Administration is saving lower-income families,$2,400 per year,, and the President has a plan to help families afford high-quality child care for 16 million children, with the average family,saving $7,200 a year,.,And thanks to the President’s Saving on a Valuable Education program, or SAVE,,the typical student borrower will save $1,000 a year,on their loan payments compared to other income-driven repayment plans.,The President has called out big corporations to pass along savings to consumers, secured historic cost-lowering legislation, directed his Cabinet to use every tool to lower costs, and eliminated hidden junk fees in nearly every area of a family’s budget. Think about what these savings mean to millions of hardworking families across the country.  That’s what this work is ultimately about: more breathing room for hardworking families. And that’s why this President is going to continue fighting to lower costs for the American people every single day.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",20-06-24,Remarks by National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard on Lowering Costs for American Consumers,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/06/20/remarks-by-national-economic-advisor-lael-brainard-on-lowering-costs-for-american-consumers/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historically low refugee admissions for four years led to drastic reductions in funding, staffing, and infrastructure across the U.S. Government agencies, international organizations, and nonprofit organizations that manage the program domestically and overseas. Through a whole-of-government effort starting on Day One, this Administration methodically rebuilt and modernized the program:,Building on the generosity of the American people through private sponsorship,Over the past few years, the Americans have extended an extraordinarily generous and welcoming hand to our Afghan allies, Ukrainians displaced by war, and Venezuelans and others fleeing violence and oppression.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Via Teleconference,11:12 A.M. EDT,MODERATOR:  Hey, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  Hope everyone was able to take some time off yesterday, if you were, and relax.,Kirby has a few words here at the top, and then as always, we’ll get through as many questions as we can.,MR. KIRBY:  Good morning, everybody.  What I want to talk about today is Ukraine and our efforts to meet their critical air defense capabilities, their needs.,For more than two years, at the President’s direction, we have prioritized strengthening Ukraine’s air defenses to help protect the Ukrainian people against Russia’s aerial attacks.  But in recent months, Russia has accelerated both its missile and its drone attacks against cities and civilian infrastructure.  They are trying to destroy Ukraine’s energy system ahead of this winter.  Again, this is not a new tactic for them, but they have certainly applied a lot more energy and effort into it in recent months.,As we’ve heard from President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian military is in desperate need of additional air defense capabilities.  We take our partnership seriously, especially when a partner like Ukraine is in such jeopardy.  Right now, we know that Ukraine urgently needs these additional capabilities.,We have continued to dig deep and provide Ukraine with a variety of air defense systems and interceptor missiles from our own stockpiles, including those of the Patriot system, NASAMs, and of course, the Hawks.,Many of our allies and partners have stepped up in historic ways as well.  But obviously, more is needed, and it’s needed now.  So as a result, the United States government has made the difficult but necessary decision to reprioritize, near term, planned deliveries of foreign military sales to other countries of particularly Patriot and NASAM missiles to go to Ukraine instead.,So let me just take a moment to explain what this means.,As you know, the United States has a robust foreign military sales program where our defense industrial base produces and then exports material to other countries, including, of course, air defense missiles.  And what we’re going to do is we’re going to reprioritize the deliveries of these exports so that those missiles rolling off the production line will now be provided to Ukraine.  This will ensure that we’ll be able to provide Ukraine with the missiles they need to maintain their stockpiles at a key moment in the war and as we get, again, towards the end of summer and into the fall.,As a result, deliveries of these missiles to other countries that are currently in the queue will have to be delayed.  To be clear, those countries will still receive the missiles that they have ordered.  It’s just that the delivery timelines will now take a little longer.,We have, of course, informed all the affected countries that we are taking this extraordinary step.  And we’re making every effort to minimize any negative impact to countries with affected foreign military sales cases.  If any of our other partners were ever in a situation similar to Ukraine’s, we would go to extraordinary lengths to support their security as well.,This decision demonstrates our commitment to supporting our partners when they’re in existential danger.  The United States firmly believes that this is the best course of action right now to support Ukraine, while still ensuring other partners receive the air defense missiles and capabilities that they’ve committed to purchase, again, on a delayed timeline.,Look, the broader message here to Russia is clear: If you think you’re going to be able to outlast Ukraine and if you think you’re going to be able to outlast those of us who are supporting Ukraine, you’re just flat-out wrong.  And we’re going to make sure that we give Ukraine the critical air defense capabilities they need now and into the future.  And we’re going to keep working with our allies and partners to make sure that they too get the air defense capabilities that they ordered.  And we’re grateful to the nations that we’ve reached out to and have not only understood but many of them have been fully supportive of this decision.,So with that, we can start taking some questions.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our first question will go to Steve Holland with Reuters.,Q    Thank you.  Along those lines, could you talk about what are the ramifications for the United States of the defense pact signed by Putin and Kim Jong Un over the last couple days?,MR. KIRBY:  Steve, I did not hear that question.  Can you repeat it?  I’m sorry.,Q    The ramifications of the defense pact that Russia and North Korea signed in the last couple of days.,MR. KIRBY:  The ramifications of the —,Q    Defense pact.,MR. KIRBY:  The defense agreement that they signed?,Q    Yes.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, look, I talked about this the other day, you know, but I’m happy to revisit it here now that they’ve made public the text of this agreement.,Number one, no surprise here, Steve.  We’ve been talking about this and warning about a burgeoning defense relationship between these two countries now for many months, through a series of downgraded intelligence that we put out there.,So we’ve been sharing information publicly about how the DPRK has been enabling Russia’s war in Ukraine and about their weapons transfers.  Obviously, it’s something that we’ve taken seriously.  If we didn’t take it seriously, my goodness, we wouldn’t have made it public and wouldn’t have been talking about it for quite some time.,Number two — and I think this should be fairly obvious too — when you look at the body of work President Biden has directed the national security team to do, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, we have been strengthening and bolstering our allies, our alliances, and our partnerships all throughout that region throughout the entire three and a half years of this administration, including through the historic trilateral agreement between the Republic of Korea and Japan and the United States, including through the AUKUS initiative, including by expanding our access and cooperation with the Philippines.  And of course, we’re going to continue to evaluate our posture throughout the Indo-Pacific as needed.,But we have prioritized this part of the world since the beginning of this administration.  And that work, that effort, we believe, has right now and will continue to put us in the best possible position to be able to thwart any threats and challenges, not just on the Korean Peninsula but elsewhere in the region.,Q    And if you —,MR. KIRBY:  But wait, just a couple more points, if I could.,That’s not to say that this development, this agreement is not a concern.  Of course, it is.  It should be a concern to any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability, not just on the Korean Peninsula but in the Indo-Pacific.  It should be a concern to any country that believes that the U.N. Security Council resolutions ought to be abided by.  It should be a concern to anybody who thinks that supporting the people of Ukraine is an important thing to do.,And we would think that that concern would be shared by the People’s Republic of China, since this agreement also seems to be in direct contrast with the statement that President Putin and President Xi made in Beijing just a month ago in which both countries called for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the situation on the Korean Peninsula.,Now, last thing I’ll say here, Steve, and then I’m happy to take any follow-ups you have, is: Our view is that this agreement is also a sign of Russia’s desperation.  I mean, they’re reaching out to North Korea for missiles, reaching — they’re still getting drones from Iran.  They don’t have a lot of friends in the world, and they’re trying to do everything they can to pull on the strings of the friends that they do have.,Russia is absolutely isolated on the world stage.  They’ve been forced to rely, again, on countries like North Korea and Iran.,Meanwhile, split-screen, if you will, Ukraine just organized a successful peace summit in Switzerland that had more than 100 countries and organizations sign up to support President Zelenskyy’s vision for a just peace.,So, last thing I’ll say, and then I promise I’ll shut up on this: We’re just going to keep supporting Ukraine as they defend themselves from Russia.  And we’re obviously going to keep looking for opportunities to strengthen, deepen, and bolster our strong and vast network of alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.,So, sorry, that was a long one.  But go ahead, Steve.  You have a follow-up?,Q    Thank you.  Just a quick follow-up.  Mike Turner is giving a speech, saying that the Biden administration isn’t taking the threat seriously enough of Russia’s space-based nukes.  What’s your response to that?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, he’s just wrong.  He’s just flat-out wrong.,Look, we have absolutely taken this very seriously.  We’ve been working this particular problem set from every possible angle, including through intense diplomacy with countries around the world and, obviously, through direct conversations with Russia.  We’ve been working hard to get other countries to join us in making clear what the dangers are of an anti-satellite weapon that’s designed to carry a nuclear weapon, just like the one that Chairman Turner is referencing.  And we put forth a resolution at the U.N. Security Council to do that just about a month or so ago.,As we said at the time, in February, when this was made public, publicizing this highly sensitive intelligence was highly irresponsible, and it was something that the intelligence community themselves had serious concerns with.  And we had assessed that starting with private engagement, rather than immediately publicizing the intelligence, would have been a much more effective approach.  So, obviously, as we said at the time, and we still are, disappointed that that opportunity was prevented by Chairman Turner’s letter and then, thus, making it public.,Nevertheless, what I can say is: We’re going to continue our efforts to dissuade Russia from putting a nuclear weapon into orbit.  We’re going to do everything possible to prevent that outcome.  This is a national security issue.  And quite frankly, it’s not something that anyone should be playing politics one way or the other.,All nations, all individuals, anybody in public service, particularly here in this country, ought to be similarly concerned about the manner in which we talk about this and the approach that we take to try to stymie the Russian plans.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Jordan with Bloomberg.,Q    Thanks, Kirby.  Two questions for you.  First, on the Patriot missiles, can you tell us a timeframe of when the countries that will have their deliveries delayed, when they’ll be able to get them?  Are we talking weeks, months, years?,And secondly, wondering if the administration is aware of a pair of major cyberattacks on a software company used by auto retailers and whether there’s been any determination if that’s been carried out by a foreign actor and if there’s any assessment of how that will affect the economy.,MR. KIRBY:  So, on your first question, what I can tell you is that we expect the first shipments from this reprioritization of air defense missiles to Ukraine will happen over coming weeks.  Certainly before the end of the summer, Ukraine will start to see the initial deliveries of these.,I can’t say with specificity what the delay is going to be like for every country that is affected by this, because these are individual contracts.  And as we have communicated to these countries and will continue to do so, we’ll do the best we can to minimize their delay as much as possible.  But each country is going to have a different set of circumstances applied to that based on how much they’ve ordered and, you know, what their own self-defense needs are.,But I also would just add that the scope of the deliveries that were given to Ukraine will span — will provide them enough capabilities over the rest of this fiscal year and, of course, all next fiscal year.  So about 16 months will be the focus of the timeframe to fill out Ukraine’s inventory.  And then, after that, the countries that have been asked to delay will start to get their deliveries.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question —,MR. KIRBY:  Oh, wait a minute, before you go to the next question.,You asked — I don’t have a good answer for you on the reports of a cyberattack on the auto industry.  I’m going to take that question, and we’ll see if we can get something a little bit better for you.,Q    Thanks, John.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, sorry about that.,Q    Thank you.  Our next question will go to Arlette with CNN.,Q    Hi, thank you.  I have just two areas I want to touch on.  Still on the Ukraine air defense capabilities: Do you have an idea of how many countries will be impacted by this?,And then, if I could also ask about Israel: How frustrated has the President been about Netanyahu’s comments claiming that the U.S. was withholding some military aid for Israel?  And what do you think Netanyahu’s motivation was in making such a claim?  And are there any plans — or where do things stand — plans for POTUS to meet with Netanyahu when he comes to Washington in July?,MR. KIRBY:  Okay, there’s an awful lot there.,Look, on the number of countries, I would just say it’s a range of countries.  But I think we’re going to respect each country’s prerogative to either acknowledge it and speak to it or not.,I would tell you — you didn’t ask this, but just to make it clear that this reprioritization will not affect Taiwan and what Taiwan continues to need and to receive from the United States with respect to their self-defense.,Look, on the Prime Minister’s comments — and I assume you mean the video that he put out, claiming that, you know, it was unconscionable for the United States to withhold assistance — I would just — a couple of points here.,Number one, obviously, we didn’t know that video was common.  And it was perplexing to say the least, certainly disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas — and, quite frankly, other threats that they’re facing in the region — than the United States.  I mean, my goodness, this President put U.S. fighter aircraft up in the air, in the middle of April, to help shoot down several hundred drones and missiles, including ballistic missiles that were fired from Iran proper into Israel.  There’s no other country that has done more or will continue to do more than the United States to help Israel defend itself.,So those comments were deeply disappointing and certainly vexing to us, given the amount of support that we have and will continue to provide Prime Minister Netanyahu.,And I think you had, like, several other follow-ups on that.  And I think I —,Q    Well, what do you think his motivation was behind making such a comment?,MR. KIRBY:  I —,Q    (Inaudible) domestic audience at home, or is he genuinely concerned about some missing aid that they haven’t gotten?,MR. KIRBY:  No idea.  You’d have to talk to the Prime Minister about what prompted him to do that.  Again, it was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect.  So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Gordon with Wall Street Journal.,Q    My question was asked.  I’m good.  Thanks.,MODERATOR:  Okay.  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nick with PBS.,Nick, you should be able — there we go.,Q    Yeah, sorry, Sam.  Thanks, John.  I think I know the answer to this, but just making sure: Does any air defense system in Israel — is that affected by today’s announcement?,And then, to go back to some statements from Israel: In the last 24 hours, what has been a private — or reasonably private, I suppose — dispute between the leaders of the IDF and the Prime Minister has exploded into public.  Do you think that what is now a public dispute between the leaders of the IDF and the Prime Minister threatens U.S. goals when it comes to Gaza and the region and the overall war in Gaza?  Thanks, John.,MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Nick.  So, on your first question: No, there’s no — there’s going to be no impact felt by Israel as a result of this reprioritization.,On your second question, I think it would be imprudent, at best, for us to speak about any intragovernmental tensions in Israel right now, except to say — I think in answer to your question — we do not believe that there’s going to be any — certainly any change to our objectives or our goals.  And we don’t see any impact of these tensions on our shared objective: getting all the hostages out, getting this deal in place, getting a ceasefire in place, and trying to find a way to end this war.,But beyond that, I’d let the parties speak to it.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Aurelia with AFP.,Q    Hi, John.  Thanks for taking my question.  A follow-up maybe.  On the Middle East: Can you confirm that Jake Sullivan is meeting today with the Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer?  And what would be the agenda for that meeting?,And another question, if I may, on Darfur.  One week ago, the United Nations Security Council demanded an end to the siege of the city of Al-Fashir.  Since then, have you seen any sign that the fighting is calming down?  And if not, what’s the administration doing to try to prevent, like, a major humanitarian catastrophe there?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m going to take your question on Darfur, Aurelia, and get back to you, rather than try to explain something that may just make me sound stupid.  So I don’t want to do that.  I want to do that right and take the question for you.,On your first question: Yes, Jake will be meeting today with his counterpart, Ha- — Hagnebi [sic], and — I’m sorry about that — and Mr. Dermer.  And it’ll be a wide-ranging discussion, I think you can imagine, about everything that’s going on with the Gaza war, with our support to Israel, with our efforts to get a better sense of how they’re continuing to prosecute operations against Hamas, as well as continuing to talk about the importance of closing on this deal.,Sorry, I blanked on his last name.  It’s Hanegbi.  Hanegbi.,Anyway, that’s the focus of that meeting today.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Haley with Scripps.,Q    Thank you.  I’m curious, on the line of the hostage ceasefire talks, if there have been any additional developments or if you’ve heard back from Hamas additionally this week.,And then, when it comes to the supply of Patriots to Ukraine, I mean, I know — I’m guessing you’re probably not going to put a specific number on this, but what impact do you expect this to make quantitatively for them when it comes to the numbers they’re asking for?,MR. KIRBY:  I can tell you, on the Patriots, it’s in the realm of hundreds that we’re talking about, as I said, over the course of the rest of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year, the entire fiscal year for ‘25.  So in the realm of the hundreds.,I don’t have an update for you on the progress on the ceasefire deal.  Again, it’s our understanding that Hamas — I’m sorry, that Qatar and Egypt are still talking to their interlocutors with Hamas and trying to see if they can close whatever gaps exist.  And we’re still hopeful and still watching this very, very closely.,And just to remind: As I said in my opening statement, it is in the realm of the hundreds, and it’s both Patriot interceptor missiles and NASAM interceptor missiles.  Both programs.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Keleigh with NewsNation.,Q    Hey, John.  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about the tensions between Hezbollah and Israel and the concerns of a wider war.  I know something you’ve spoken about and the administration has spoken out about not wanting to see this grow into a wider war.,On Tuesday, the IDF approved operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon.  Since that approval, what discussions have the U.S. had to try to deescalate the situation?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, as you know, our envoy, Amos Hochstein, has been in the region the last few days, shuttling back and forth between Tel Aviv and Beirut to have these exact conversations.,I won’t speak to IDF military planning; they need to do that.  I would just tell you that we still don’t want to see a second front opened up.  Obviously, we take the tensions and the rhetoric seriously by both sides.  And we’re doing everything we can to try to prevent that outcome.  And those conversations are ongoing, literally as we speak.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Anita with VOA.,Q    Thank you so much, John.  Going back to Putin and his travels in Asia: He’s headed to Hanoi.  Is there any indication, that you are aware of, that he seeks material support from Vietnam for the Ukraine war?,And then secondly, with the top State Department official headed to Hanoi as well this week, is the U.S. seeking a debrief from Hanoi on Putin’s visit?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, obviously, we have an embassy there, and they’ll certainly have, in due course, appropriate conversations with their counterparts in the Vietnamese government.,But, look, I would just say, broadly speaking, our expectation is that Vietnam will continue to adhere to its commitment to, and its commitment and support for, the basic principles of the U.N. Charter, which include sovereignty, which include territorial integrity, and that they’ll continue, as they have, to convey that these principles need to be upheld all across the world — in Europe, as well as in Asia.,I’ll let the two countries speak for themselves about the particulars of this visit and whatever they might agree to coming out of it.  But I think it’s — I would remind you that that we, the United States, President Biden, elevated our bilateral relationship with Vietnam to a historic level, basically upgrading it to a comprehensive strategic partnership.  And that’s a partnership that we believe reflects well the strength of that bilateral relationship.  And we’re going to stay focused on continuing to deepen it, broaden it, improve it for our own mutual benefit to each other and to the region.,We’re focused on this bilateral relationship in ways that we don’t believe anybody else really is, and we’re going to stay focused on that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Yuna with Channel 12.,Q    Hi, Kirby.  Hi, Sam.  Thank you for doing this.  First, to follow up about a question I don’t think was answered.  Is there a plan for a meeting between the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu during his speech in Congress?,And the second thing is: After the video by Netanyahu, was there any talks behind the scenes?  I know that he met Special Envoy Amos Hochstein, but was there any attempt to scale it down a little bit?  Any apology coming from Israel?,MR. KIRBY:  So, on your first question, I don’t have anything on the President’s schedule to speak to.,On your second question, I think we’ve made it abundantly clear to our Israeli counterparts, through various vehicles, our deep disappointment in the statements expressed in that video and our concerns over the accuracy in the statements made.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nathan with KAN.,Q    Thanks so much for taking my question.  Going back to the issue of arms shipments to Israel, could you give us an update on the status of these 2,000-pound bomb shipments?,And is there anything to add about the shipment itself or advancing the deal of the F-15 fighters to Israel?  Has that been approved, and will that go ahead?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m going to let the State Department speak to the F-15 question; that’s really more in their lane.  I will just tell you a couple of things.,Number one, as I said earlier, material assistance to Israel and their ability to defend themselves has continued — has continued to flow, even though there had been a pause put on those 2,000-pound bombs.  I don’t have an update for you on that one way or the other.  But the idea that we had somehow stopped helping Israel with their self-defense needs is actually just not accurate.,On the F-15s, the only other thing I’d add is that these would be slated to be delivered in, like, 2029, if they’re approved.  And that approval process is ongoing, not related at all to the current conflict.  But again, I’d point you over to the State Department to talk about that in a little bit more in detail.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Neria with Israel 13.,Q    Hey, Kirby.  Thank you so much for doing this.  After hearing Netanyahu’s remarks, we’ve heard really tough comments by the White House, and also, we’re hearing you now saying that it was very disappointing.  Did you try to tell — to say anything to Israeli officials about it?  Are you about to say today in your official meetings with Sullivan and senior officials in Israel?,MR. KIRBY:  As I said earlier, I think to a question a few minutes ago, we’ve made it clear at various levels, through various vehicles, our concerns over the content of that video.,Q    And why do you think that he did that?  Why do you think that he put that video out there?  Do you have an assumption?,MR. KIRBY:  No idea.  You’d have to talk to the Prime Minister’s office.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Morgan with Semafor.,Q    Hey, John.  Thanks so much for doing this.  Just one follow-up on the decision to reprioritize the air defense capabilities to Ukraine.  You mentioned you notified other countries will be affected.  What kind of reaction did you get?  I mean, were they understanding?  Was there a level of concern there?,MR. KIRBY:  I think I could describe it as broadly understanding of it.,Q    Thank you.  And I think we have time for one more question.  We’ll go to Marek with Polskie Radio.,Q    Thank you, Sam.  Hi, John.  On missiles: You said that Taiwan and Israel won’t be affected.  What about countries on the eastern NATO flank, close to Russia and Ukraine?  Are those countries excluded?  If not, why?  There were cases when Russian missiles flew over Poland during Russian attacks on western Ukraine.,And my second question: Are you also considering putting on hold or redirecting deliveries of Patriot and NASAM systems itself, including launchers and radars?,MR. KIRBY:  Including launchers?,Q    And radars.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, so to your first question, as I said earlier, we’ll let the countries affected speak for themselves on this.  As I said, the response we got was broadly supportive.  And many of the countries that we talked to were, in fact, very supportive of this because they know how serious the need is in Ukraine.,As for the actual amount, this is about — just to be clear, this decision is about reprioritizing the deliveries of missiles, the actual interceptor missiles.  We did take a look at the broader system writ large — the launchers, the radar systems, all that go with that — and I think we’d be open to it.  But the way that FMS is — foreign military sales program — is structured, right now we just don’t have eligible systems coming off the production line.  So it was something we looked at, but right now the focus is really going to be on the missiles themselves.,Q    Can I take it as a confirmation that eastern NATO flank countries are not excluded from the hold?,MR. KIRBY:  Again, I’ll let other countries speak for themselves.  As I said, we spoke to a number of countries about this, and I don’t think we’re going to identify them here today.  We’ll let those countries speak for themselves.  I mean, we’re talking about air defense capabilities here.  And some countries will likely be more willing to talk about their participation in this effort than others, and they should speak for themselves.  So I’m just not going to get into that.,But I do want to go back, if I could, just on your question about systems.  One thing I forgot to mention was: Separate and distinct from this effort — and as I said, we’re open to continue to look at the possibility of systems themselves being redirected.  But even before this decision, we had been working closely with other countries, in Europe and beyond Europe, that have systems — launchers, radar systems, and support systems — about their willingness to contribute those systems to Ukraine’s air defense capabilities.  And so, that effort is ongoing; I would even describe it as a parallel effort.  And we’re going to continue to do that going forward.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And thanks, everyone, for joining.  As always, if we weren’t able to get to you, reach out to the NSC press distro, and we’ll try to get back to you as soon as we can.  Thanks, everyone.,END    11:44 A.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Today’s Supreme Court order ensures that women in Idaho can access the emergency medical care they need while this case returns to the lower courts. No woman should be denied care, made to wait until she’s near death, or forced to flee her home state just to receive the health care she needs. This should never happen in America. Yet, this is exactly what is happening in states across the country since the Supreme Court overturned,Roe v. Wade,.,State abortion bans are also forcing doctors to leave Idaho and other states. In January, I heard heartbreaking testimony from Dr. Kylie Cooper, a physician who cared for patients with high-risk pregnancies in Idaho. After practicing medicine under Idaho’s extreme abortion ban—which went into effect after,Roe v. Wade,was overturned—Dr. Cooper made the difficult decision to uproot her family, leave the community she loved, and move to a different state. Because of the state ban, and for the first time in her career, she was unable to offer the care her patients with certain pregnancy complications desperately needed.,Doctors should be able to practice medicine. Patients should be able to get the care they need. Instead, Dr. Cooper’s story is the reality for doctors and the women they care for since,Roe v. Wade,was overturned. And make no mistake: this is all part of Republican elected officials’ extreme and dangerous agenda to ban abortion nationwide, and put women’s health and lives at risk.,The stakes could not be higher and the contrast could not be clearer. My Administration is committed to defending reproductive freedom and maintains our long-standing position that women have the right to access the emergency medical care they need.  Vice President Harris and I will continue to fight for a woman’s right to make deeply personal health care decisions. And we will continue to fight to restore the protections of,Roe v. Wade,in federal law, for all women in every state across the country.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",27-06-24,Statement from President Joe Biden on Moyle v.

Participating administrators represented Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state, and Washington, D.C.,Earlier this year, the President released his FY 2025 Budget, which proposes a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program to ensure that all workers can take the time they need to bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one’s military deployment; find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or grieve the death of a loved one. The Administration applauds the thirteen states and the District of Columbia that have passed paid leave laws, and continues to call for a national paid family and medical leave program.,During the meeting, Administration officials underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to pursuing a national paid family and medical leave program, while supporting the leadership and efforts of state programs paving the way—implementing programs that uplift families, our economy, and the fight for paid leave at the national level. Representatives from the Department of Treasury announced that the agency is working on guidance on the tax treatment of state paid family and medical leave programs that would provide greater clarity to existing and future programs.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",27-06-24,Readout of White House Meeting with State Paid Leave Administrators,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/27/readout-of-white-house-meeting-with-state-paid-leave-administrators/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi, all.,Q    Hey.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, I got a — two things at the top.,So, today’s Supreme Court order ensures that women in Idaho can access the emergency medical care they need while this case returns to the lower courts.  But our fight is not over.  The Biden-Harris administration will continue to defend our long-standing fundamental belief that women have the right to access the emergency medical care they need.,No woman should be denied care or wait until she’s near death or forced to flee her home state just to receive the health care she needs, yet this is exactly what is happening in states across the country since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.,It’s all part of Republican elected officials’ extreme and dangerous agenda to ban abortion nationwide, put women’s health and lives at risk, and threaten doctors with jail time.  The stakes should not be higher, and the — I’m sorry, the stakes could not be higher, and the contrast could not be clearer.,President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to fight for a woman’s right to make deeply personal health care decisions and to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law for all women in every state across the country.,Second, the president has repeatedly said that we must secure our border.  That’s why, about three weeks ago, he announced actions to bar migrants who cross our border unlawfully from receiving asylum.,Since then, unlawful crossings between ports of entry have dropped more than 40 percent.  We’re still early in implementing the president’s actions, and we understand that migration flows are dynamic.  That is why we continue to call on Congress to provide our immigration officials and Border Patrol the resources they need to do their jobs.,Republicans in Congress have proven that they would rather have a political football than actually fix the problem.  We will continue calling on congressional Republicans to do their jobs and give border officials the resources only Congress can provide.,With that, Darlene, you want to kick us off?,Q    Yes, thank you.  To follow up on your topper on the Supreme Court case out of Idaho, given the outcome of that case, is the administration considering suing any other states, you know, like Texas, with similar — that have similar circumstances?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything to announce or to lay out.  That’s certainly going to be up to the Department of Justice as it relates to any litigation.  They’re — something that they can speak to.,What I can say is our fight is not over.  So, we’re going to continue to defend what I said at the top — the administration long view of making sure that a woman has the right to access emergency medical care.  That’s — continues to be our — our stance.,And so, we will continue to investigate complaints; take enforcement actions as appropriate; and ensure that doctors, hospitals, patients understand that rights and obligations under — the rights and obligations under EMTALA.,Anything further beyond that, I just don’t have anything to add.,Q    What —,Q    And one to the president.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    He’s been at Camp David for more than a week.  Can you tell us anything about his mindset going into tonight, his mood?  Have you seen him since we’ve been airborne?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, a couple of things — and I’m going to be really mindful, follow the law — Hatch Act, all of the things.  And I’ll say this.  Look, the president is president wherever he is.,Obviously, we — we — there was the Dobbs decision.  You heard from the president then.  You heard from the vice president.  You — you heard us lay out — I just star- — stated this at the top about what the — what we have seen at the border and the 40 percent drop, which I think is also important.  So, he’s able to do the job wherever he is.  There’s the infrastructure to do just that.,And I’ll say this.  You know, whenever there’s an opportunity for the president to speak directly to American public — in this instance, it’ll be millions of Americans watching — he takes that opportunity very seriously.  And he understands that Americans are going to be watching, wanting to hear from their president, wanting to hear what he’s been able to accomplish this last three and a — three and a half years.,This is something that he does regularly, obviously, and to lay that out — to lay out the contrast on what we’ve been trying to do and what Republicans have been trying to do — extreme Republicans at that.  I just talked about the Dobbs decision.  I just talked about EMTALA.,All of these things that we’re seeing, as it relates to reproductive freedom and — and contraception, you know, being — being on the line and IVF and what we’re seeing with 27 million women in 21 states that have abortion restrictions, what they’ve had to be going through — it is happening because of what the last administration did, because of the overturning of Roe v. Wade.,So, these are the things that you’re going to continue to hear the president talk about, the contrast, whether it’s the economy, whether it’s expanding health care, giving — making sure we’re giving Americans a little bit of breathing room and not giving tax cuts to billionaires and corporations.  That’s not where we are.  We want to protect Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.  Republicans want to continue to try to gut that.,So, you’ll — you’ll continue to hear the president lay out what he’s done in three and a half years and, obviously, as we do regularly, give that stark contrast and lay out what’s at stake.,Q    Are you — are you happy with the debate rules, the fact that there’s no audience, the mic will be turned off?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s something for — for the campaign to speak to.  As you know, that was a discussion that they had.  And so, I’m going to leave that to them.,Q    And — and what’s the president’s feeling about standing toe to toe with his — his main adversary tonight?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I — I’m not going to speak directly to tonight and directly to his main adversary this evening.,But, look, you know this president.  He likes to fight.  He likes to fight for the American people.  He believes on standing up for the American people.  You see him do that over and over again.,And so, look, I would — I would refer you to the State of the Union — not just this year but also last year — and how he was able to take — to take extreme Republicans in the room on.  I — I’m just going to leave that there.,Q    Sticking with the — with the Supreme Court in another decision today.  Does the administration have any concerns on the Supreme Court’s decision and the SEC case to curb in-house judges?  Just any comment or reaction to that case and if it could potentially limit enforcement on financial rules and regulations.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m not going to speak to that.  We’ve been always very, very mindful on that.  So, I’m j- — I just don’t have anything to add to the — to the Supreme Court ruling.,Q    Karine, could you give us few details about what these past few days have looked like for the president at Camp David?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I don’t have anything more to add to answering Darlene’s question.,Look, the president is the president wherever he is.  He, you know — obviously, he continues to do the work of the American people.  The last couple of days, we’ve made some important announcement on things, on matters that the majority of Americans care about, whether it’s the Dobbs decision, marking the two-year anniversary.  I just talked about immigration, what’s happening at the border, securing the border, and the actions that the president took — the executive actions that the president took not too long ago.  We laid that out for all of you yesterday — the 40-percent decrease at the border.,I don’t have anything else to add.  I’m sure the campaign will have more specifics on that.  But I’m just going to stick to what the president — how the president delivers every day for the American people.  That’s — that’s my — that’s my lane.  That’s my role.  And that’s what I’ll stick to.,Anything else?,Q    Is — is — sorry.  Is the president concerned that the Kenyan government caved to violence and overturned their new tax laws?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things on that.  Give me one second.  Guys, I can’t see.,Q    (Inaudible.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Kenya, yeah.,So — so, obviously, we’re deeply concerned about — about what — what is occurring there and obviously condemn the reported violence in all forms.  We offer our deepest condolences to the families who have been impacted and continue to urge restraint so that no further Kenyans are put in harm’s way while exercising their constitutional, protected right to peacefully, publicly assemble.,We are encouraged by recent — by President Ruto’s openness to dialogue and will continue to push for calm to prevail.,So, answering that question, I think it’s important to have that open dialogue and wh- — we are — I think we are encouraged by that open dialogue that the president of Kenya is currently having with — with folks on the ground.,Q    Does the president have confidence in the effectiveness of the Gaza pier is — that the Pentagon has opened up a Inspector General look into it.  Does he — does he think it’s money well spent?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’ll say — I’m not going to speak to the IG investigation.  That’s something that I won’t get into.,Look, we have always said one of the things that this president wanted to do is get that increased humanitarian aid into Gaza.  We’ve — we’ve been very clear about that.  And we’ve said — and you’ve heard Jake Sullivan talk about air, land, and sea.  Right?  And so, this is part of that effort.,We’re confident in that effort, in making sure that we’re getting those really important goods and aid that the people of — of Gaza, Pal- — innocent Palestinians need into — obviously into Gaza.,So, that’s always going to be our focus.  And anything more specifically about the process and how that’s moving forward with the pier, certainly, I would refer you to the — to the Department of Defense.,But again, that is the president’s commitment: to increase,— to increase that aid.  And so, that is something that the president — that — that we’ve been incredibly focused on.,And I do want to share some total figures here.  Since the beginning of the conflict, President Biden has been leading the effort to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.  And it was a result of the president’s effort that assistance was allowed into Gaza after October 7th.  Overall, total of nearly 16,000 trucks since April 5th and a daily average of 190 trucks have been going in a day.  And that is, again, because of the president’s leadership.  And we’re going to do everything that we can to increase that aid.,Q    Julian Assange’s lawyer says he deserves a pardon and that President Biden should give him one.  Is that under consideration or even discu- — being discussed?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it’s not.,Q    And what is the response to former President Trump’s claims that President Biden may be taking something tonight to boost his performance?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t think that I should dignify that with an answer.,Q    Did — did Jake — when Jake spoke to the Israeli Defense Minister yesterday, did they talk about post-conflict Gaza, the plan for that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  They di- — yes, they did.  They did talk about that.,Let me see if I can find it.  Yikes.  Let me lay that out for you.,So, one of the things — like I said, they — yes, they did discuss that — Jake Sullivan and obviously the Defense Minister.  They also discussed, obviously, a wide range of issues.  And we issued out a readout of the conversation yesterday that they had.,Go ahead.,Q    And on the what appeared to have been a failed coup in Bolivia.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’re glad that — that calm has been restored.  And I’ll just leave it there.,Q    I had a question about tomorrow.  Can we go to tomorrow?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Tomorrow?,Q    There’s an official event on his schedule.  Do you have any details about what he’s going to be doing in New York City after —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, they’re — they will be campaign events.  So, I would refer you to the campaign.,Q    But it says “official” on the guidance.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, you’re talking about — not tomorrow.  You’re talking about — oh, you’re talking about the New York pieces of it.  We’ll have —,Q    The first one.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The first —,Q    It said “official.”  The second one —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ll have more to share later today.  We’ll have more details to share for sure.,Q    What about —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, are you guys just coming up with things at this point?  (Laughter.),Q    No.,Q    Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Thanks, everybody.,Q    Thank you.  Appreciate it.,END  2:28 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE,THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY,SUBJECT:       Extending Eligibility for Deferred Enforced,Departure for Liberians,Since 1991, the United States has provided safe haven for Liberians who were forced to flee their country as a result of armed conflict and widespread civil strife, in part through the grant of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED).,In December 2019, the Congress enacted the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92) (NDAA), which included, as section 7611, the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF) provision.  The LRIF provision, with limited exceptions, makes Liberians who have been continuously present in the United States since November 20, 2014, as well as their spouses and children, eligible for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident (LPR).  The NDAA gave eligible Liberian nationals until December 20, 2020, to apply for this adjustment of status.  After the enactment of the LRIF provision, President Trump further extended the DED transition period through January 10, 2021, to ensure that DED beneficiaries would continue to be eligible for employment authorization during the LRIF application period.,The LRIF application process was new and complex, resulting in some procedural and administrative challenges.  Recognizing these difficulties, the Congress enacted a 1-year extension to the application period in section 901 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260).  That legislation, however, did not provide for continued employment authorization past January 10, 2021.  Through my memorandum of January 20, 2021 (Reinstating Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberians), DED was subsequently reinstated through June 30, 2022, in order to permit employment authorization for eligible Liberians while they made their applications for adjustment of status under the LRIF provision.  My memorandum of June 27, 2022 (Extending and Expanding Eligibility for Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberians) (2022 Memorandum), further authorized an extension of DED for 24 months, ending June 30, 2024, and expanded eligibility to those Liberian nationals, or persons without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who had been continuously physically present in the United States since May 20, 2017.,There are compelling foreign policy reasons to extend DED for those Liberians who have been continuously present in the United States since May 20, 2017, and were eligible for DED under the 2022 Memorandum.  Providing protection from removal and work authorization to these Liberians, for whom we have long authorized TPS or DED in the United States, honors the historic close relationship between the United States and Liberia and is in the foreign policy interests of the United States.,Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interests of the United States to extend through June 30, 2026, deferred removal for those Liberians already under a grant of DED under the 2022 Memorandum.  I have also determined that these Liberian nationals should have continued employment authorization through June 30, 2026.,The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly direct the appropriate officials to make provision, by means of a notice published in the Federal Register, for immediate allowance of employment authorization and prompt issuance of new or replacement employment authorization documents in appropriate cases for covered Liberians.,This grant of DED and continued employment authorization shall apply to any person who was eligible for a grant of DED under the 2022 Memorandum, to include any Liberian national, or person without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who has been continuously physically present in the United States since May 20, 2017, but shall not apply to such persons in the following categories:,(1)  individuals who would be ineligible for TPS for the reasons provided in section 244(c)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(B);,(2)  individuals who sought or seek LPR status under the LRIF provision but whose applications have been or are denied by the Secretary of Homeland Security due to ineligibility for the LRIF provision under sections 7611(b)(1)(C) and (b)(3) of the NDAA;,(3)  individuals whose removal the Secretary of Homeland Security determines is in the interest of the United States, subject to the LRIF provision;,(4)  individuals whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States;,(5)  individuals who have voluntarily returned to Liberia or their country of last habitual residence outside the United States for an aggregate period of 180 days or more, as specified in subsection (c)(2) of the LRIF provision; or,(6)  individuals who are subject to extradition.,Accordingly, I hereby direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take the necessary steps to implement for eligible Liberians:,(1)  a deferral of enforced departure from the United States through June 30, 2026, effective immediately; and,(2)  authorization for employment valid through June 30, 2026.,The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.,JOSEPH R.

Raimondo,is yet another deeply troubling decision that takes our country  backwards. Republican-backed special interests have repeatedly turned to the Supreme Court to block common-sense rules that keep us safe, protect our health and environment, safeguard our financial system, and support American consumers and workers. And once again, the Supreme Court has decided in the favor of special interests, just as it did when they sought to gut long-standing protections for clean water, thwart efforts to respond to a global pandemic, and block the cancelation of crippling student debt for tens of millions of Americans.,While this decision undermines the ability of federal agencies to use their expertise as Congress intended to make government work for the people, the Biden-Harris Administration will not relent in our efforts to protect and serve every American.

EDT,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Kate Cox!  (Applause.)  Isn’t she extraordinary?  And what good news.  Just extraordinary, Kate.  As I said to you and your husband backstage, you really have been so courageous and such a leader in this movement.,You know, I — I shared with Kate that — and please have a seat if — if there are chairs.  (Laughter.)  They have chairs.  (Laughs.),I said to Kate that, you know, I think, in moments of crisis, that the universe has a way of revealing the heroes among us who show extraordinary courage — not looking for any award or reward but just because they feel so strongly about something and being a voice for so many people.,And, Kate, you are a hero of this movement and in this moment, and thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.,And I want to thank all the elected officials and members of Congress who are here — (applause) — Senator Van Hollen, Representative Glenn Ivey.,And I will acknowledge the next senator from the great state of Maryland, my dear friend, Angela Alsobrooks.  (Applause.),And to all the leaders who are here and have been fighting, are fighting to make sure every woman in our nation, every person in our nation can access the care they need and, in particular, reproductive healthcare.,So, this is a fight for freedom — the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not having her government tell her what to do.,Two years ago today — (applause) — two years ago today, I think many of us remember where we were.  Two years ago today, the highest court in our land, the court of Thurgood and RBG, took a constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America.,And two years ago, on that day, I actually made a prediction that overturning Roe v. Wade would be the opening shot on a full-on assault, state by state, on reproductive freedom.  And that is exactly what happened.,Over the past two years, in states across our nation, extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and punish women — laws that limit access to contraception and to fertility treatments like IVF.  Even some of them trying to revive laws from the 1800s.,Today in America, one in three women — one in three women of reproductive age lives in a state with an abortion ban.  Many with no exception even for rape or incest.,Today, our daughters know fewer rights than their grandmothers.,This is a healthcare crisis.  And we all know who is to blame: Donald Trump.,And how do we know?  Well, as many of you know, I’m a former prosecutor.  So, let’s just look at the facts, shall we?,When he was in the White House, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court because he intended for them to overturn Roe v. Wade.  And as he intended, they did.  So, it was premeditated.,Since, extremist legislators across our nation have passed ban after band after ban.  He had accomplices.,And Trump has not denied, much less shown remorse for his actions.  Instead, he quote, “proudly takes credit” for overturning Roe.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  My fellow Americans, in a court of law, that would be called an “admission” and, some would say, a “confession” all pointing to the ultimate issue.  In the case of the stealing of reproductive freedom from the women of America, Donald Trump is guilty.  (Applause.),And over the past two years, we have seen the impact of these Trump abortion bans — the horrific, heartbreaking reality that women have been facing every single day in our country.  Women have been refused care during a miscarriage, turned away from the emergency room, and only given care when they develop sepsis.  We have seen attacks on IVF, women denied the freedom to make some of the most personal decisions in their lives.,And understand: As much harm as he has already caused, a second Trump term would be even worse.  His friends in the United States Congress are trying to pass a national ban that would outlaw abortion in every single state — in states like New York and California and even right here in Maryland.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And we all know if Donald Trump gets the chance, he will sign that ban.  And how do we know?  Well, when Congress tried to pass a national ban in 2017, he endorsed it and he promised to sign it if it got to his desk.  And now, he wants us to believe he will not sign a national abortion ban.   Look, enough with the gaslighting.  (Applause.)  Enough.,And if we needed any more proof on where he stands on this issue, Donald Trump just announced he has already decided who his running mate will be.  Without knowing that person’s name — (laughs) — we already know it is someone who wants to ban abortion.  Every person on his shortlist either supported a ban in their state or supported a national ban.,And it doesn’t stop there.  If there were a second Trump term, he has admitted that he is, quote, “looking at” restrictions on contraception.  And pay close attention to how his friends in the United States Senate obstructed a bill to protect the right to contraception not once, not twice, but three times.,So, it comes down to this.  Donald Trump thinks the government is in a better position to tell women what’s in their best interest than women are to know for themselves.  But Joe Biden and I trust women.  (Applause.)  And women trust all of us to fight for their most fundamental freedoms.  (Applause.),And fight we will.  And fight we will.,And, you know, as I travel our country, it is clear that most Americans do believe one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.  (Applause.),And when Congress passes a law that restores the reproductive freedoms of Roe, our President, Joe Biden, will sign it into law.  (Applause.),AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Indeed.,So, here’s the bottom line.  Here’s the bottom line.  It’s going to take all of us to get there.  (Applause.)  It’s going to take all of us to get there, and momentum is on our side.,Think about it.  Since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, the people of America have voted for freedom.  (Applause.)  From Kansas to California to Kentucky, in Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and Ohio, the people of America have voted for freedom — and not by a little but often by overwhelming margins, proving this is not — this is not a partisan issue, proving that the voice of the people has been heard and will be heard.,So, today I ask: Are you ready to make your voices heard?  (Applause.),Do we trust women?  (Applause.),Do we believe in freedom?  (Applause.),Do we believe in the promise of America?  (Applause.),Are we ready to fight for it?  (Applause.),And when we fight, we win!,God bless you.  And God bless America.,Thank you.  (Applause.),END                       12:07 P.M.

Part of that effort includes creating the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever — the SAVE Plan — which for months has allowed 8 million Americans access to lower monthly payments and has already helped hundreds of thousands of borrowers get their remaining debt cancelled more quickly.,It’s unfortunate that Republican elected officials and their allies have fought tooth and nail to prevent their constituents from accessing lower payments and a faster path to debt forgiveness — and that courts are now rejecting authority that the Department has applied repeatedly for decades to improve income-driven repayment plans.,Today’s rulings won’t stop our Administration from using every tool available to give students and borrowers the relief they need. That’s why the Department of Education will continue to enroll more Americans in SAVE and help more students and borrowers access the benefits of the plan that remain available, including $0 payments for anyone making $16 an hour or less, lower monthly payments for millions more borrowers, and protecting borrowers from runaway interest if they are making their monthly payments.,President Biden and his Administration will continue to build off of the progress made delivering debt cancellation to over 4.75 million Americans through various actions, and we will never stop fighting for students and borrowers – no matter how many roadblocks Republican elected officials and special interests put in our way.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",24-06-24,Statement by White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on District Court Rulings on the Biden-⁠Harris Administration’s SAVE Plan,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/24/statement-by-white-house-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-district-court-rulings-on-the-biden-%e2%81%a0harris-administrations-save-plan/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wade,, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Gender Policy Council, and Tom Perez, Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, convened Attorneys General from Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, and Oregon to discuss the devastating impact of dangerous abortion bans implemented by Republican elected officials and the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to protect access to reproductive health care in their states and nationwide.,Participants discussed how the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn,Roe v. Wade,has led to extreme abortion bans in 21 states and has paved the way for attacks on the full spectrum of reproductive care, including medication abortion, emergency medical care, IVF, and contraception. While Republican elected officials continue to advance abortion bans in states and at the national level, the Biden-Harris Administration and Democratic Attorneys General are fighting back to protect access to reproductive health care. Directors Klein and Perez thanked the participants for their leadership and reaffirmed the Administration’s commitment to defending reproductive freedom.,President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to make deeply personal health care decisions and continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of,Roe v. Wade,in federal law. Yesterday’s discussion builds on the Administration’s long-standing commitment to partnering with state leaders on the frontlines in the fight for reproductive rights. The White House has hosted,more than two dozen formal convenings,of state officials, including governors, attorneys general, and state legislators. The Vice President has led these efforts, traveling to more than 20 states to meet with state legislators, health care providers, and advocates and leading a nationwide Fight for Reproductive Freedoms tour earlier this year to continue fighting back against extreme attacks throughout America.,Participants:,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",25-06-24,Readout of White House Meeting with State Attorneys General on the Second Anniversary of the Overturning of Roe v. Wade,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/25/readout-of-white-house-meeting-with-state-attorneys-general-on-the-second-anniversary-of-the-overturning-of-roe-v-wade/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Herzliya, Israel,It is my pleasure to be here to speak about the U.S.-Israel partnership, and how things look from Washington.,We all know the past 8 and a half months have been an extraordinarily difficult time.  There are still not words to describe the horrors of Hamas’s brutal massacre of 1200 people on October 7 — or of the taking of 250 innocent hostages and unthinkable acts of sexual violence.,And the war triggered by that attack has had devastating consequences.  Tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, including women and children, have been killed—and humanitarian conditions for the people of Gaza, where the majority of the population has been displaced, remain dire.,In Israel, almost 200,000 Israelis have had to evacuate their homes, and many have yet to return.,In addition: Just over two months ago, Iran launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israeli territory.  Houthi militants and Shia militia groups continue to strike at Israeli and other targets.  Hezbollah attacks Israel regularly across its northern border, and Israel is responding.,Meanwhile, Israel is facing growing international criticism and pressure from the United Nations and other international bodies.  Vocal segments of the American public have spoken out against the war in Gaza. As a result, over the past eight and a half months the U.S.-Israel partnership has been tested, perhaps as never before.,It has been a profoundly trying time for all.  But I need not remind everyone here: the U.S.-Israel partnership has always faced challenges.  There have been many difficulties – even crises – in our shared history – and we have survived all of them, together.  And while it will require work on both sides, there is no reason why this time needs to be different.,Indeed, notwithstanding all the very real challenges and tests I have mentioned, I believe there is a positive path forward for Israel, the United States, and our strategic partnership.,And that is what I want to talk about today – not the risks and problems we all know but the possibility of a more hopeful path forward, for Israel, U.S.-Israeli relations, and the people of the region.,The path to a more hopeful future starts with the ceasefire deal spelled out by President Biden on May 31, based on Israel’s proposal.  That proposal offers the opportunity to end the war in Gaza in a way such that Israel is secure; all the hostages are returned; Hamas no longer governs Gaza; and the Palestinian people have a hopeful political horizon to freedom, security, and an eventual state living side by side with Israel in peace.,You are familiar with the terms of this proposal but they are worth repeating: Phase 1 would be a 6-week full and complete ceasefire; withdrawal of Israeli forces from population centers; and the release of hostages, including women, the elderly, and the wounded.  In this time, Palestinian civilians could return to their homes, and humanitarian assistance would surge.,During this period, there would also be negotiations for Phase 2 – a permanent cessation of hostilities.  During the second phase, there would be an exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers; and Israel would withdraw from all of Gaza.,Then in Phase 3, a major reconstruction plan for Gaza would begin, and any additional hostage remains would be returned.,Now, as President Biden has said, we know there are some in Israel who do not support this proposal, opposing a ceasefire even if that means de-prioritizing the release of the hostages.  We strongly disagree.,A rejection of this deal would not bring about some undefined version of “total victory,” but would lead to endless conflict, draining Israel’s resources, contributing to its global isolation, and preventing the hostages from being reunited with their families.  By contrast, implementation of the deal brings the hostages home, and opens up the pathway to the more hopeful future we all need.,Since President Biden made this proposal public, we have rallied the world to support it.  The UN Security Council passed a resolution endorsing it.  G7 nations have all endorsed it.  As have many Middle Eastern countries and the 16 countries that have citizens still held hostage in Gaza.,It is now time for Hamas to accept the deal.  And let’s be clear: By refusing to do so, Hamas is responsible for the ongoing suffering of so many Palestinians.  The deal Israel offered at the end of May was almost identical to what Hamas proposed on May 6, and in many ways Hamas is walking away from its own offer.,While disappointing that Hamas took so long to respond and has proposed additional amendments beyond its original position, we will continue to work relentlessly to get to that agreement and to close the gaps, and we are grateful for the efforts of Qatar and Egypt to help do so.,And we should not give up hope for getting a deal even as we press Hamas to agree, Israel can help with that.,As Israel completes major operations in Rafah in the days and weeks ahead, and if it delivers on its promise to reduce civilian casualties and surge more humanitarian assistance, not only will that relieve the suffering of the Palestinian people…it will deprive Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar of the death and destruction he cynically counts on for leverage against Israel.,Don’t forget – Sinwar wants to see Israel isolated in the world, wants to bring in regional actors against Israel, and wants to divide Israel from the United States.  A transition to lower intensity military operations and an improvement in the humanitarian situation in Gaza would deprive him of all of these goals, as well as of the fantasy that the longer he holds out the more leverage he has.  We need to make Sinwar realize time is not on his side, and that the deal is one he should accept.,Let me also say a word about what this deal could mean for Israel and the region.,Fully implementing this deal— with an end to the fighting in Gaza, followed by a serious commitment to governance, reconstruction and security — would bring desperately needed relief to the civilian population of Gaza and allow the people there to begin a process of recovery.  But it would also deliver enormous political and security benefits to the State of Israel and the Israeli people.,First, it would significantly increase the possibility of securing calm along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, which would allow tens of thousands of Israelis to finally return to their homes. We have been working relentlessly to deter Hezbollah from a major attack on Israel since the early days of this conflict.  As you know, President Biden sent two aircraft carrier groups to the region and has strongly warned Hezbollah against intervention.,To be clear, we utterly reject the Iranian and Hezbollah linkage between continued fighting in the north and a ceasefire in Gaza.  We believe de-escalation is possible and necessary now and that is what are working towards. But we also know that a ceasefire and hostage deal would put pressure on Hezbollah to end its reckless cross-border attacks — helping to diminish the risk of escalation in the north.,A sustainable ceasefire in Gaza would also reduce the risk of escalation on other fronts.  Since early on in the Gaza conflict, the Houthis in Yemen have been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea – reckless, illegal behavior that does nothing for the people of Gaza while causing enormous harm elsewhere.,The United States will continue to degrade Houthi capabilities and seek to deter future attacks until this outrageous behavior ends.  A return to calm in Gaza would deny the Houthis their self-proclaimed justification for these attacks and help reduce the risk of escalation on this front as well – as it would the risk of attacks from Shia militia groups in Syria and Iraq.,Perhaps most important, an end to the war in Gaza — and a commitment to a serious and credible Palestinian political horizon — would also allow Israel to secure a potential historic normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia – and ultimately the entire Muslim world.  This would be an extraordinary boon for the Israeli economy – opening new economic ties for Israel’s start-ups, travel and tourism, educational exchanges, and more.,And even more important it would help make Israel safer.  It would allow Israel to be part of a regional security network, with the support of the United States, to counter the threat posed by Iran.,We saw the potential for this in mid-April, when Iran launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel, and a coalition of nations, including the United States and our regional partners, helped Israel defeat that attack.  That episode underscored the reality of the threat Israel faces from Iran, but was also a striking preview of what is possible when Israel becomes more integrated with the region.,The path to this brighter future is possible, but to return to where I started, it begins with a sustainable end to the war in Gaza in a way that leaves Israel secure, brings the hostages home, removes Hamas from power, and ensures a path to Palestinian dignity, freedom, self-determination, and security.,The reality is that there is no enduring defeat of Hamas without a credible governance and security alternative in Gaza – as we in the United States learned the hard way from our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan.,With the end of fighting, we can create a unified international and regional coalition to support Palestinian governance, rebuild Gaza, and ensure that Hamas cannot regain power. As we do that, we will put in place strict measures – including on the border between Egypt and Gaza – to ensure Hamas and other terrorists cannot re-arm.,I know it is hard to think of peace negotiations at this moment.  I understand the mutual distrust that Israelis and Palestinians have towards each other after years of conflict and failed peace processes; The United States is certainly not asking Israel to sacrifice its security or immediately come to an agreement on two-states.,But we cannot give up on that ultimate goal, and we oppose steps — such as settlement expansion, settler violence and other destabilizing activities on the West Bank — that are counterproductive to peace and make that goal more difficult to achieve.,President Biden and Vice President Harris firmly believe the best way to ensure Israel’s long-term security is through a negotiated two-state solution that will allow Israel to remain a secure, Jewish and democratic state.,I also want to be clear that the onus is not just on Israelis but also on Palestinians, which is why we are engaging the newly appointed Palestinian Authority government to advance important reforms that make meaningful changes to improve governance.,Ultimately, through the regional track and the Palestinian track, this path I’ve described opens up prospects for Israel to build enduring security – which is what this country needs and has wanted from its founding.,All of this runs through securing a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza now, as President Biden has proposed, and we should all be working to achieve.,To conclude, I would just ask all of you to contemplate the two paths I have just described, in one direction; indefinite conflict in Gaza alongside growing tensions and violence in the West Bank; the absence of a Palestinian political horizon as fuel for Hamas and other terrorist groups; the looming threat of serious regional escalation; and growing Israeli isolation on the world stage – or in the other direction the path to a strong, secure and prosperous Israel; at peace with its neighbors; backed by the United States; and integrated in the region as never before.,The choice should be clear.,As Israel embraces this more hopeful path, the United States will stand with Israel every step of the way.  We remain Israel’s strongest, and best friend in the world.  And Israel remains our closest ally in the Middle East.  And just as I believe it is in Israel’s interests to pursue this positive pathway…it is also in America’s interest.,Even in this moment of tension and difficulty, this future is possible.  It is a path worth pursuing.,Thank you.,# # #,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",24-06-24,Remarks by National Security Advisor to the Vice President Dr. Phil Gordon at the Herzliya Conference,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/24/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-to-the-vice-president-dr-phil-gordon-at-the-herzliya-conference/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,The Carter Center,Atlanta, Georgia,2:14 P.M. EDT,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.,AUDIENCE:  Good afternoon.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And to all the Bison in here: You know.  (Laughter.),MR. JACKSON:  Wow.  Y’all, give it up one more time for Quavo and the Vice President of the United States of America.  (Applause.)  This is amazing.  This is nothing short of amazing.  But I want to get out of the way and hear from our amazing speaker.,So, first, Madam Vice President, you travel the country connecting with communities and young leaders.  Just this past fall during the “Fight for Our Freedoms” college tour, you engaged over 15,000 students on college campuses across the country on the most urgent issues of this moment — in particular, the fight for our most fundamental freedoms.,One freedom you are focused on is the freedom to be safe from gun violence.  And so, it’s no surprise that you oversee the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.,Now, what can we do, from your perspective, to end this senseless violence?  And how is the administration leading on this issue?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Greg.  Let me just start by talking about Quavo.  (Laughter.)  So, Quavo and his mother and his aunt — Takeoff’s mother —,QUAVO:  Sister.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — sister — came to my office in the West Wing of the White House to talk about this issue.  And it was a difficult conversation that day because the issue is such a difficult one.  And I know there are — there are a lot of families here and survivors.  And the pain that is associated with gun violence in America is almost unspeakable.  And it is everywhere.,And what Quavo has been doing with The Rocket Foundation to — to translate that pain and that grief into something that is about creating strength and empowerment in the community, including among our young people, is really extraordinary.  And as I said to you that day, Quavo, in my office, that you have chosen to use your celebrity, the gift that you have as an artist to talk about and actually work on with action this issue is really extraordinary.,You are an incredible leader and a national leader on this.  And I thank you for that, as the head of the first White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention and as Vice President of the United States.  (Applause.),QUAVO:  Thank you, thank you.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Really.  Really.,And so, this issue is — well, let me just start with this: It doesn’t have to be this way.  And we have to hold on to and remember that.  It does not have to be this way.  We cannot ever normalize this.  We cannot ever get used to it.  And we certainly cannot accept it.,We need to understand that everyday gun violence is as serious as mass shootings — that any life lost, any life that has been impacted by gun violence is one life too many.  We have to think about this in the many ways that the injury occurs, which includes, of course, the — the tragedy of life that is lost but also the trauma that is a additional form of injury that can exist for a lifetime if we don’t put resources into calling it what it is and putting the resources into diagnosis and treatment.,Let’s think about it in terms of the tragedy that gun violence in America is the number-one killer of the children of America — not car accidents, not cancer — gun violence.  One in five Americans has a family member that was killed by gun violence.  Gun violence — Black victims of gun violence — 10 times more likely to be a victim of gun violence.,So, it’s a real issue that requires everybody’s priority in terms of addressing it.  And there are many ways to do it that include also what we need to do around election time, which is about recognizing that too many people, who I will call “cowards,” have been pushing this false choice to suggest you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away.  That’s a false choice.,I’m in favor of the Second Amendment.  I also believe there is no reason why we have assault weapons on the streets of America.  (Applause.)  They are weapons of war.  We need an assault weapons ban.  I’m in favor of the Second Amendment.,I’m in favor of the Second Amendment, and we need universal background checks.  I’m in favor of the Second Amendment, and we need red flag laws.  (Applause.),And we need the people in the United States Congress to have the courage to stand up to the gun lobbyists and take action around what is just reasonable.,Universal background checks — you just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon if they’ve been found to be a danger to themselves or others.  You just might want to know.  (Applause.)  That’s reasonable.,Assault weapons — assault weapons are designed to kill a lot of people quickly.  There’s no place for them in the neighborhoods and the streets where people live and go to school and worship.  We’ve seen what they do.,So, there are solutions.  And that’s part of the work that I’m doing with the Gun Violence Prevention Office at the White House is to work on those solutions, including what we have recently done through that office, which is to put a billion dollars into hiring mental health counselors in our public schools to help address — (applause) — the mental health aspect of this.  Yes.,MR. JACKSON:  Amazing.  Madam Vice President, you spoke of courage.  And there’s nothing more courageous than losing someone and stepping up and taking action.  And — and, Quavo, you did one of the bravest things with your family by coming to Washington and advocating for change.  And so, I’m just curious if you can share a little bit about why is this issue so important to you, you know, and why is it so important for you to take action after suffering such loss.,QUAVO:  I’m a victim.  I got a second chance.  I feel like I wouldn’t be here if everybody — you know what I’m saying?  It would have — I just look at myself as, like — when I saw him laying there, I feel like I saw me laying there.  So, I feel like if — when I’m — when I’m doing something like The Rocket Foundation, I just want to uplift his legacy and make sure to keep his name alive.  So, that’s why we here.  (Applause.),MR. JACKSON:  It’s alive and well.,Speaking of legacies, Madam Vice President, gun violence causes trauma and deeply impacts our mental health and especially true for young folks who are going through active shooter drills, that are losing their friends and families at such a young age.  And you have spent your career — I would argue, most of your life — working on this issue — as District Attorney, 20 years of pouring into efforts to be smart about how we prevent violence —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.,MR. JACKSON:  — and really elevating the national model for how we deal with stress and trauma amongst our youth.,I also just want to mention, as California Attorney General, you created the Bureau of Children’s Justice to shape the state’s response to the crisis of childhood exposure to trauma.,And as the Vice President, you continue to emphasize the importance of addressing the trauma that too many of have — of us have faced with gun violence.,And so, would love for you to talk a little bit more about how you’ve been fighting to prioritize mental health and, really, resources and support to help those who have been impacted by trauma.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mm-hmm.  Well, gun violence in the neighborhood, in the community, without any question, results in trauma.  And you — just think about trauma as being an invisible wound but a wound nonetheless.  And like any wound, if it does not heal in a healthy way, it will continue to be a problem.,I will say that there are many sources of trauma.  Poverty is trauma-inducing.  (Applause.)  When you start compounding sources of trauma, then you can just imagine how the trauma is even more severe.  So, let’s speak truth about that as well.,But, you know, on the issue of — of what I’ve seen in particular about the trauma that — that comes from exposure to violence, you know, some people will simplify the point of post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.,And — and one of the ways that I’ve heard it simplified — but it makes sense — is imagine every day you’re walking across a very busy street and, out of nowhere, some — a Mack truck comes barreling down.  Without reflection, you’ll — you’ll produce what’s called,a cortisoid,[cortisol].  You — your body will i- — will absolutely just react without reflection, and you’ll jump back.,But if every day, at different points in times, that — that Mack truck comes, you’re going to overproduce that thing — to th- — that — that is the thing that your body is designed to do to help you deal with stress.,But when you overproduce it, one day, as this — this example goes, you’re walking across the street, you look up, you see that Mack truck coming, and you keep walking.  Because you’ve so overproduced this thing that it makes you numb.,It’s really important to understand that that is one of the symptoms of exposure to trauma-inducing things.  Because, you know, when we talk about how especially our young people are misdiagnosed — when people will look at our young people and say, “Oh, they don’t have any emotion or feelings.  That response to this thing doesn’t seem like a healthy response.”  Well, when people have been overexposed to trauma-inducing events, that’s physiologically what happens.,So, we have to also elevate the conversation about what trauma looks like and the effects — what the effects of trauma look like.,It includes that a young person — or any — of any age, by the way — will have trouble sleeping at night; will have depression; will have flashbacks; if they’re in class, will act out and then get labeled the “bad kid,” which just produces a whole other cycle of then getting — right? — put on detention, getting kicked out of school.,So, this issue of early diagnosis and treatment of trauma has profound impacts on everyone from our youngest to of any age.  And part of, then, the work that — that, Quavo, you’ve been doing with the foundation and what we’ve been doing is to elevate the importance of dealing with mental health.,And it’s something that all communities need to address, but we, in particular, have to remind people.  When we talk about healthcare, for too long people have acted as though the body starts from the neck down.  Well, what about the healthcare we need from the neck up?  That’s healthcare.,And so, mental health care is important, but we got to put the resources into it.  And the thing that we know is we need to have culturally competent mental health care providers.  (Applause.),You mentioned, Greg, I did the college tour last fall.  And I went to a number of schools, including our HBCUs, of course.  And I would — I would challenge the young people — you know, like there was, back in the day, challenging people to go into public service — I’m challenging our young leaders: Think about a calling for yourself in the profession of mental health, whether it be from being a therapist to — to being — you know, going to medical school.  But we need more people doing this stuff.,And — and the one thing that I find with our younger leaders is they are more willing to talk about mental health than people of older generations.  And I think — I see that as a sign of opportunity.,But to meet them where they are — where they are and what they’re asking for, we need more resources going into the treatment.  And — and I think we can — we can get there.  And we’ve already — for the work that we’ve done — over 300 mental health counselors in the public schools of Georgia as a result of the work the President and I have done.  (Applause.),And — and I will add one more thing.  Please pass the word.  There’s a crisis line that we’ve set up: 988.  And here’s the thing to let people know about that: You can be anonymous.  You can text it.  You can call it.  You can have a conversation.  Sometimes, it’s just about creating safe places for people to talk — just to be able to talk.,And so, 988 is something that we should get the word out where it’s anonymous, you can just call and talk with somebody about how you are feeling in a safe place.,MR. JACKSON:  Thank you.  I want to ask the room real quick: Raise your hand if you’ve lost someone to gun violence.,And so, I just think it’s fair of me to speak from the room, Madam Vice President, just thank you for seeing us.  Thank you for seeing how deep this is cutting our community.  I know, for me, I couldn’t sleep for months.  I think our first few conversations, Quavo, you were going through the same thing.,QUAVO:  Yeah.,MR. JACKSON:  And for too often, our trauma is overlooked.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.,MR. JACKSON:  And it just means so much.  It really does.  So, just thank you.  Thank you for seeing us.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.,QUAVO:  Thank you.  (Applause.),MR. JACKSON:  Quavo, you have been an inspiration to me and — look at this big room — (laughs) — of so many people from Atlanta — but not just an inspiration o- — musically but in your community and really on the entire culture — Black culture in America.,And I just want to thank you, because you’ve been fighting for resources for our communities and — and for youth all over the country.  And Rocket Foundation is such a huge, transformative organization.  And I just want to give you some space to talk more about why this is important and — and the vision that you have for this foundation.,QUAVO:  I mean, like I said, it — it didn’t hit hard until it hit home with me.  So, we founded The — The Rocket Foundation honoring my nephew’s legacy.  And just seeing the progress and seeing the support and seeing — we got the Vice President; we got all y’all in here that actually had the same experience that I have.,And it’s just — like, once again, like, me being on this stage is — is very, very tough for me.  At the end of the day, it’s like I’m — I’m already, like, a year missing with my — my nephew.,So, just seeing some type of progress — we launched the Spark Grants.  And, you know, we want to make sure that we get these organizations that want to do something about it, you know, funded.  We want to make sure we support them.  I feel like everybody need, like, a plug.  (Applause.)  I feel like — in mu- — in music, we say — in music we say a “plug.”  (Laughter.)  And so, I just — I just want to be the plug to the community and — and help change.,MR. JACKSON:  Hey, let’s go.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.),THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Keep it real.  (Laughter.),MR. JACKSON:  Yeah.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I said, “Keep it real.”  (Laughter.),MR. JACKSON:  Speaking of the plug — (laughter) —,Well, Madam Vice President, we would love to — to close with one more question from you.  I mean, there’s so many amazing young leaders here that are streaming from all over the country: survivors, activists, frontline providers, violence intervention, mentors — so many leaders.,And I’m just curious, what would you say to the young leaders of the future of how they can be a part of the change and really help turn this issue around?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll start with this.  You were born a leader.  And for the young leaders who are here now, you have clearly decided to activate that as early and as soon as possible.  And that inspires all of us.,Our country needs you.  Our country needs you.  (Applause.),And so, here’s — here’s — so, I — I got plenty of advice.  Okay, here you go.,MR. JACKSON:  Let’s go.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, let’s start with this.  You’re going to hear many times in your life, “Oh, nobody like you has done that before.”  “Oh, you’re too young.”  “Oh, it’s not your time.  Wait your turn.”  This is one I love: “Oh, it’s going to be hard work.”  Don’t you ever listen to that.,Let me tell you.  I — I have a saying: I eat “no” for breakfast.  I don’t hear “no” until maybe the 10th time, and I don’t hear it then either.  (Laughter.),So, don’t ever listen when someone tells you that the thing that you have passion about that you know can be done — don’t ever listen when somebody tells you it’s not possible.,The other piece of advice I have is this.  Don’t ever be burdened by other people’s limited ability to see who can do what.  (Applause.)  That’s not your problem.  That’s not your problem.  That’s their problem.,I’ve got more advice.  (Laughter.)  There will be many times when you’re going to be in a room — a meeting room, a boardroom — where you’re going to be the only one that looks like you in that room, the only one who’s had the experiences that you’ve had.,I want you to look around this room and hold this image in your heart and in your mind.  And you remember, when you walk in those rooms, we are all in that room with you.,And so, we expect and require that you walk in that room with your chin up and your shoulders back, knowing you are carrying the voice of so many people who are so proud that you are there.,Don’t ever let anyone suggest to you that you are alone, because that’s one way to make somebody feel like they don’t have people.  You have people.  You have people who stand with you.,And so, these are some of the things that I think is so important for our young leaders to remember — and, in particular, our young leaders right now.,You know, you talked, Greg, about the active shooter drills.  You know, when I was growing up, the closest thing we had was fire drills.,MR. JACKSON:  Mm-hmm.  Yep.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right?,Our children, our young people — when I was doing the — the college tour — and I was doing it with college-aged people, so I was doing trade schools as well as universities and stuff.  And I would ask the young people, “Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill.”  Almost every hand went up.,This one young person said to me — younger than the college students — and said to me, “Yeah, that — that’s why I don’t like going to fifth period.”  I said, “Why, sweetheart?  Why don’t you like going to fifth period?”  And they said, “Well, because, in fifth period, there’s no closet to hide in.”,So, we talk about trauma.  It includes — especially when you’re talking about children who are exposed to everyday gun violence and they’re doing active shooter drills, worrying about who might bust through the classroom door, think about what — what — what our children are carrying in terms of the fear, when their — their beautiful big brains should be open to the wonders of the world and being taught about the wonders of the world and excited about that.,And so, back to our young leaders.  Your voices on so many issues, including this one, are based on a lived experience, which gives you the authority and the right and the entitlement to go out and speak your truth and require that people listen to you — and don’t stop talking until people listen to you.,We are counting on you.  And, you know, when — I think when our young leaders start voting in their numbers on issues like this, we’re going to see a sea change, because they’re not going to wait.  They’re not going to wait, and they are not falling for the okey-doke.,So, that’s — that’s my advice.,And then, I guess my last piece is this.  So, I was proud, when I was in the United States Senate, to be one of the sponsors to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, which — and Juneteenth — (applause) — yes.  And — and Juneteenth is tomorrow.,So, you know, a lot of people have said, “Well, how should we be celebrating?”  And, you know, we have the traditions, of course, but how should we think about it now as a federal holiday?,So, one of the things that I’ve — I’ve issued is a call to action.  So, I would invite everyone to participate.  Is — among the many ways that you celebrate Juneteenth, think about how you can ask just your neighbor or your cousin or somebody to make sure they’re registered to vote.  Let’s think of it as a day of action to register people to vote as well for Juneteenth.  (Applause.)  So —,QUAVO:  (Inaudible.),THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — there we go.,MR. JACKSON:  I just want to add one quick thing for — for all the young folks out there.  We have our great partners at AmeriCorps that are here as well.  And so —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes.,MR. JACKSON:  — please give them a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  And —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.),MR. JACKSON:  And there are over 500 sites of AmeriCorps where you can sign up and join the team officially to help us address the issue of gun violence.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And don’t we have some paid jobs in the connection with AmeriCorps?,MR. JACKSON:  Oh, yes, ma’am.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Let’s talk about that.,MR. JACKSON:  Yes, ma’am.  The average program pays $2,914 a month.  But, you know, who’s counting?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.),MR. JACKSON:  But they are great programs to get you started.  And we — we would love to have you — be a part of your service work and being paid for that effort.,So — and one last thing I’ll just share —,QUAVO:  I want to shout out —,MR. JACKSON:  Oh, yes.  Please, sir.,QUAVO:  I just want to shout out, shine a light on the Rocket Camp and go back to how she said everything started with the youth.  So, what we will be doing — we — we’re going to open up the Rocket Camp and have — where all my Rocket Camp kids at?  Where they at?  They in here?  (Applause.)  Okay, cool.  Yeah, so — yeah.  Right there.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Oh —,QUAVO:  Yeah.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — my goodness!,QUAVO:  We’re going to keep them — we’re going to keep them boys —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Oh, my goodness.,QUAVO:  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  (Applause.),THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Ohh — (laughs) —,QUAVO:  So, I’m going to make sure I pull up to the camp.  And, you know, we’re going to make sure we play basketball, some — have some fun things.  And at the same time, we — it’s — it’s gun prevention programs and — and many other programs in there.  So, I’m hands-on.  I will be coming to see y’all boys at Rocket Camp.  (Applause.),THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  Oh, that’s wonderful.,MR. JACKSON:  So, Madam Vice President, would you like to share the last word?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We have more work to do, but good work is happening.,And let’s not let — let’s not let anybody make us think that we cannot make a difference.  There’s so many people here who — with — that raised their hand.  You’ve been through so much.  And it’s never-ending, in some ways.  But we can’t let these circumstances take away our purpose and our knowledge that we can make a difference.,And I look at this leader, Quavo, as an example of that.  You inspire so many people, including me.  (Applause.),QUAVO:  Thank you.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Because this is exactly what leaders do.  They figure out a way to turn pain into purpose in a way that benefits so many.,And I’ll — and I’ll just end with this.  You know, th- — I think that there’s been something kind of backward that’s been happening in our country in the last few years that is to suggest that the strength of the — of a leader is measured based on who you beat down, when, in fact, the real strength of a leader is measured on who they lift up.  And that’s what you are doing.  (Applause.),MR. JACKSON:  Yes.  Please give it up one more time, y’all, for Quavo and the Vice President of the United States of America.  (Applause.),END                  2:41 P.M.

EDT,THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, North Carolina!  And I’ll get in trouble with my mom looking down in Heaven if I don’t say please excuse my back, I apologize.  (Applause.)  (Inaudible.),It’s good knowing you — it’s good knowing you have my back.  (Applause.),Eric, thank you for that introduction.  We had a wonderful time spending time with your sons, Christian and Carter.  They’re going to grow up to be incredible young men.  You would have been really impressed the way they talked about their dad, how informed they were about what was going on.  I was truly impressed.  And I ate two hamburgers.  (Laughter and applause.),And a special thanks to Roy and Kristin Cooper.  Roy, you’ve been a great governor — (applause) — which makes it all the more important that North Carolina elect a great governor to replace you, Josh Stein.  (Applause.),And when I’m reelected again with your help, I want you to know that I’m not promising not to take Roy away from North Carolina.  (Applause.)  Whether he’ll come or not, I don’t know.  (Applause.),And thanks to all the state and local leaders here today, and the great musicians and entertainers who performed earlier.,Folks, let me tell you why I’m here in North Carolina.  I’m here for one —,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.),AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  That’s okay.,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  That’s okay.,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  I’m here in North Carolina for one reason: Because I intend to win this state in November — (applause) — and we’re going to see that ha- — I think we are.,And Roy is right.  We win here, we win the election.  (Applause.),And here’s how we’re going to do it.  We’re going to stand up for the women of America.  (Applause.)  We’re going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.  (Applause.)  We’re going to stand up for the right to vote.  (Applause.)  And we’re going to stand up for Medicare and Social Security.  (Applause.)  And we’re going to fight for childcare, paid leave, and eldercare.  (Applause.),And we’re going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs, not just for seniors but for every single American.  (Applause.)  We’re going to keep protecting the Affordable Care Act — (applause) — which is why more than 40 million Americans have health insurance today that didn’t before.  (Applause),We’re going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets.  (Applause.)  We’re going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed Internet, quality education for every child in America.  (Applause.),We’re going to secure our border and protect legal immigration.  (Applause.),And unlike the other guy, we’re going to stand up to dictators like Putin, because — (applause) — America bows to no one — no one — no one ever.  (Applause.),Folks — and we’re going to keep dealing with the climate crisis.,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  Look, and more than — and more than anything, we’re going to preserve, protect, and defend our democracy.  (Applause.)  Because more than anything else, that is what is at stake in America this election — (applause) — your freedom, your democracy.  America itself is at stake.  (Applause.),Now, folks, I don’t know what you did last night, but I spent 90 stages — 90 minutes on the stage debating the guy who has the morals of an alley cat.  (Laughter and applause.),Did you see Trump last night?  My guess he set — and I mean this sincerely — a new record for the most lies told in a single debate.  (Applause.),He lied about the great economy he created.  He lied about the pandemic he botched, killing millions of people.  (Applause.)  He closed businesses.  He closed schools.  Losing their homes — people all over this country.,America was flat on its back.  So, I told Trump that he was just one of two presidents in American history who left office with fewer jobs than he started.  Herbert Hoover was the other one.  (Laughter.)  That’s why I call him Donald “Herbert Hoover” Trump.  (Applause.),And then he lied about how great he was for veterans.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  But then I told him how he had called a veteran who had given their lives in the country in World War I — he refused to go to the gravesites — he called them “suckers” and “losers.”,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  He tried to deny it.  But let me ask you, are you going to believe a four-star Marine general, his own former chief of staff, John Kelly, who said he said that or the disgraced, defeated, and lying Donald Trump?  (Applause.),My son was one of those people — not in World War I but in the v- —,Folks, look, how about the fact that 44 —,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.),AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more year!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  How about the fact —,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  That’s okay.,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  How about the fact that 40 out of his 44 top advisors, including the vice president, aren’t supporting him this time around?  The people who know him best — 40 of them said, “I will not support the man I worked for this time around.”  It tells you a lot about — the person who knows him.,Look, he lied about how great he was on crime.  I had to remind him that he oversaw a record increase of murder rates in 2020.  And on my watch, violent crime has hit a 50-year low.  There’s more to do, but 50-year low.  (Applause.),And then, I pointed out that the only convicted criminal on the stage last night was Donald Trump.  (Applause.),When I’ve thought about his 34 felony convictions, his sexual assault on a woman in a public place, his being fined $400 million for business fraud, I thought to myself, “Donald Trump isn’t just a convicted felon.  Donald Trump is a one-man crime wave.”  (Applause.)  And he’s got more trials — he’s got more trials coming up.,AUDIENCE:  Lock him up!  Lock him up!  Lock him up!,THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the time for that — (laughs).,AUDIENCE:  Lock him up!  Lock him up!  Lock him up!,THE PRESIDENT:  Look, the thing that bothers me maybe most about him: He has no respect for women or the law.  He doesn’t.,And then, his biggest lie.  He lied about how he had nothing to do with the insurrection on January the 6th.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  We all saw with our own eyes.  We watched it on television.  We saw thousands of insurrection attack the Capitol.  We saw police being attacked, the Capitol being ransacked, the mob hunting for Speaker Pelosi, gallows literally set up for Mike Pence.  And then, he told them as he sat in the dining room — the one di- — one — the private dining one door off my Oval Office.  He sat there for three hours watching the TV.  He did not a single thing to stop it — nothing, nothing at all.,And now —,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  And now, he wants to pardon all those convicted criminals.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  But, folks, for all his lies, we did learn some- — we learned some important truths about Donald Trump last night.  We learned he’s still proud of being the person who killed Roe v. Wade.,We learned —,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  No.  We learned he’s still proud about the pain and cruelty he’s inflicted on America’s women.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  We learned he still believes that politicians, not doctors and women, should make decisions about a woman’s health.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  We learned that if he’s elected again and the MAGA Republicans pass a national ban on abortion, he will sign it.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  Donald Trump says he thinks Roe v. Wo- — Roe — overturning Roe v. Wade was a beautiful thing.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  I think it was a nightmare.  (Applause.)  No, I really mean it.  A nightmare.,And I made it clear again last night: If you elect me and Kamala and you give us a Democratic Congress, we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.  (Applause.),He continued to lie.  He said I quadrupled taxes — where the hell has he been? — (laughter) — which is a simple lie.  I didn’t raise the tax on anyone in America that made less than $400,000 a year, and I won’t in my second term either.,We learned that Trump — (applause) — who had the largest deficit of any president in four years because of the $2 trillion tax cut to the super wealthy — we learned that Trump wants to give another giant tax cut for the very wealthy and the biggest corporations.  This time, $5 trillion — not a joke — $5 trillion.  To pay for it, he’s going to cut Medicare and Social Security.  He’ll cut health care.  They’ll do it all, with millions of working middle-class Americans all paying for another tax cut for the very wealthy.,Then, to add insult to injury, he wants to raise taxes on the average family $2,500 a year.  What amounts to a new 10 percent sales tax on all products imported in America — that’s his new plan — for food, coffee, candy bars, and so much more.  It’s going to raise the tax on the average family $2,500 a year.,And most dangerously, though, we learned that Donald Trump will not respect this year’s election outcome.  He’s still not — he rejected the last time out.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  No, think about it.  Every court in the,nand,[land] ruled that it was a fair election.  He’s still denying it, still telling lies.,Three times, Trump was asked last night by the moderators: Would he respect the election results if he lost this time?  Three times, he refused to answer.  Three times.,Folks, Donald Trump refused to accept the results in 2020, and we all saw what happened on January the 6th.  It’s a direct consequence of that.  It was an international embarrassment.,By the way, as I go these international meetings — I know every major world leader — I literally — because I’ve been around, as you might have noticed.  (Laughter.)  But they ask, “Does he really mean this?” “Is that — was this real?”  It caused a constitutional crisis and international embarrassment.,Now, Trump is making it clear that if he doesn’t win this time, there will be, in his words, bloodshed — blood-,—,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  No president has ever said anything like that.  No president.  His words, not mine.,Are we going to let Donald Trump attack our democracy again?,AUDIENCE:  No!,THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think so.,Folks —,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.),AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, we’ve come a long way.   We’ve come a long way from the mess that Donald Trump left us.  We came out of the pandemic.  We’re a long way from where — Donald Trump telling us to inject bleach in our skin, that COVID is not that dangerous.,Today, we have the strongest economy in the world without exception — (applause) — 15 million new jobs; 800,000 manufacturing jobs; unemployment under 4 percent for a record two years in a row — (applause) — historic Black and Hispanic unemployment down; historic creation of small businesses — Black and all communities across the nation, particularly in rural areas; historic economic growth; inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3, and it’s still going down.  (Applause.),I know we have more to do to get prices down.  We have to take on corporate greed.  They’re making twice the profit they were before the pandemic.,We got to make housing more affordable — (applause); provide childcare — (applause); make the tax code fair — (applause).,Sixteen Nobel winners of the economic mo- — Nobel Prize have looked at my economy — economic plan.  This week, they’ve i- — issued a report.  And on Trump’s plan.,Here’s what they concluded.  They said that my plan would continue to grow the economy and bring down inflation.  (Applause.)  Sixteen Nobel laureates.  And that Trump’s plan would send the nation into recession and inflation soaring through the roof.,AUDIENCE:  Boo —,THE PRESIDENT:  Don’t take my word for it.,Folks, let me close with this.  I know I’m not a young man — (laughter) — to state the obvious.,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.),THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know.  (Applause.),AUDIENCE:  Joe!  Joe!  Joe!,THE PRESIDENT:  Well — I don’t —,AUDIENCE:  Joe!  Joe!  Joe!,THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, I don’t walk as easy as I used to.  I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to.  I don’t deba- — debate as well as I used to.  But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.  (Applause.),I know — I know — I know right from wrong.  (Applause.)  And I know how to do this job.  (Applause.)  I know how to get things done.  (Applause.)  And I know like millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.  (Applause.),I know what it took to take our economy from the depths of pandemic to where it is today: the strongest economy in the world.  I know what it’ll take to bring this economy to everybody.  I know what it’ll take to rally the world to stand up against Putin and defend freedom, not yield to him.  (Applause.)  And I know what it’ll take to keep the world safe and free for the years ahead.,Folks, I give you my word as a Biden.  I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job.  (Applause.)  Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.,AUDIENCE:  Yes, you can!  Yes, you can!  Yes, you can!,THE PRESIDENT:  The stakes are too high.,AUDIENCE:  Yes, you can!  Yes, you can!  Yes, you can!,THE PRESIDENT:  Donald Trump — Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this nation.,AUDIENCE:  Yes!,THE PRESIDENT:  He is a threat to our freedom.,AUDIENCE:  Yes!,THE PRESIDENT:  He is a threat to our democracy.,AUDIENCE:  Yes!,THE PRESIDENT:  He’s literally a threat for everything America stands for.,AUDIENCE:  Yes!,THE PRESIDENT:  Look, he doesn’t understand what I think all of you do.  America is the finest, the most unique nation in the world.  (Applause.),We’re the only nation in the world — and I mean this sincerely.  It’s a fact statement, not a hyper- — hyperbolic statement.  It’s fact.  We’re the only nation in the world built on an idea.  All other nations are built on ethnicity, geography, and other — religion.  But we’re built on an idea that we’re all created equal — (applause) — and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.  (Applause.),We’ve never fully lived up, but I’ll be damned in the year 2024, just two years — just two years before the 250th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence that I’ll let Donald Trump walk away from it.  (Applause.),I give you my word — I give you my word as a Biden.  We’re still a nation — I believe our civilization believes in honesty, in decency, and treating people with respect.  I still believe we’re a nation that gives everyone a fair shot and leaves nobody behind.  (Applause.),We are still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor.  (Applause.)  And we’re still the beacon to the world.  We can never give up what makes America America.  (Applause.),Donald Trump is motivated by revenge and retribution.  But revenge and retribution never built a damn thing.  (Applause.),You and I, we Americans are a nation of hope, optimism, and possibilities.  (Applause.)  That’s what always built America, and that’s going to continue to build America today.  (Applause.),The choice in this election is simple.  Donald Trump will restore our democracy; I will defend it.  (Applause.),Well, folks, are you with me?  (Applause.),Donald Trump is the first president I’ve heard of that stood up there and running for president having been one — one term, saying, “America is a failing nation.”  Where the hell does he think he is?,AUDIENCE:  Boo —,THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m serious.  A failing — I don’t know a president who wouldn’t trade places with America in a heartbeat.  He’s dead wrong.  America is not a losing nation.  America is winning.  (Applause.),As I stand here today, I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future in my whole career.  We just have to remember who we are.  We are the United States of America.  (Applause.)  And there is — there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity — nothing — when we act together.,AUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!,THE PRESIDENT:  You’ve got it.,AUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!,THE PRESIDENT:  So, may God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Let’s go get them, North Carolina.  (Applause.),(Referring to the First Lady.)  She finally did marry me.  (Applause.),1:37 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Aboard Air Force One,En Route Queens, New York,3:02 P.M. EDT,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi, everybody.,Q    Hello.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I have Michael Tyler with me as well.  I just have one thing at the top, and then we’ll get going.,So, today, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled the state’s extreme and dangerous abortion ban can go into effect.  This latest abortion ban and the 21 other abortion bans across the country were made entirely possible by the previous administration when three Supreme Court justices were handpicked with the goal of overturning Roe v. Wade.,In Iowa, abortion will now be banned before a lot — before a lot of women even know they’re pregnant.,These bans put women’s health and lives in jeopardy.  They’re scary, they’re dangerous, and they infringe on our fundamental freedoms.,And it’s not stopping at the state level.  Republican elected officials in Congress have proposed four national abortion bans while refusing to protect nationwide access to IVF and contraception.,President Biden believes that women in every state must have the right to make deeply personal decisions about their health care.  And — and he will continue to call on Congress to restore the protections or Roe v. Wade in federal law once — once and for all.,And with that, I have our communica- — well, the president’s campaign communications director, to be clear, Michael Tyler, who is going to take any campaign questions that you have.  I — I think you had something at the top, right?,MR. TYLER:  Yeah, I’ll just start and open up too.  Good to see everybody.,Everybody was obviously at the speech today in North Carolina.  You know, the president came, gave a very forceful, powerful speech today in North Carolina talking about the stakes of this election, calling Trump to task not just for the lies that he spewed on the debate stage last night but for the fundamental contrasts that we have in this race moving forward, the things that Donald Trump talked about on the debate stage — him celebrating the role that he played in overturning Roe v. Wade — right?; him denying or refusing to commit to accept the results of the election if he’s — loses it again this time; and, of course, the extreme economic approach he wants to return us to.  The president spoke about all of that again today.,Obviously, I think the president said himself he’s not as good as a debater as he used to be.  He doesn’t walk or talk as smoothly as he used to.  But he knows how to fight like hell.  And I think he showed that today in North Carolina.,And so, that’s what the American people are going to continue to see day in and day out for the remainder of this campaign: a president in Joe Biden who understands he’s never going to stop fighting for the American people and he’s never going to stop contrasting that against Donald Trump, who every single day is clearly fighting for himself.,I think what you saw last night after the debate was the president leave the debate stage; go rally supporters — grassroot supporters in Atlanta; went and got some food at Waffle House — excuse me; hopped on the plane here to Raleigh; touched down in Raleigh at nearly 2:00 a.m. to a b- — meet a bunch of supporters on the tarmac, shook every single hand; then got back up this morning, gave the speech that we all just saw, made a forceful demonstration of what the choice and what the stakes are in this election; and he’s going to continue to do that day in and day out for the remainder of this campaign.,So, we’re excited coming off of today.  He understands that sometimes you get knocked down, but you get back up and you keep fighting.  And that’s exactly why the American people elected him in the first place, and it’s why they’re going to reelect him again in November.  So, with that, I’ll take a few questions.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Darlene.,Q    Given the president’s appearance in Raleigh, was it a mistake to insist on no audience for the debate?,And secondly, what kind of outreach is the campaign doing to Democrats and others who are concerned about winning in November based on his performance last night?,MR. TYLER:  Yeah, so, I think one of the things that the American people got to see last night on the debate stage was Donald Trump in prime time as well.  They got to see the Donald Trump that has been speaking at the MAGA rallies since he launched his campaign, where he has, every single day, been talking about ruling as a dictator on day one, where he’s been calling for a bloodbath, where he’s been celebrating January 6th, promising to pardon the insurrectionists of January 6th.,The vast majority of the American people had not heard that at all until last night.  And so, last night was one of the first times that the American people are going to begin to see the extremism that Donald Trump represents and just how harmful a second Trump term would be moving forward.,So, I think the President is honest about his own performance.  But as far as what last night’s debate actually provided for the American people, it — it crystallized the threat — it begins to crystallize the threat that Donald Trump poses.,And so, that’s what we’re going to continue to focus on as we head into the summer months, as more and more people begin to tune into this election and Donald Trump, who’s no longer in the — on the sidelines of American politics, returns to the,limelight.,Q    And not having an audience?,MR. TYLER:  No, listen, I th- — again, I think it forced Donald Trump — you — what you saw Donald Trump do throughout the course of that debate as it went on was — obviously, he spent the entire night lying.  But as the debate went on in prime time, without an audience for him to feed off of, he became more unhinged, he started to spew more and more lies, and he reminded the American people of exactly why they fired him in the first place.,When he said that the overturning of Roe was a great thing; again, when he refused to commit to accept the results of an election; when he, again, said that his corporate ta- — giveaways were the right thing to do — that’s what the American people have rejected already.  They have not necessarily heard him say that in prime time, but that’s what they got to see last night.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay —,MR. TYLER:  I think he’ll —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I’m so sorry.,MR. TYLER:  Go ahead.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m so sorry.,MR. TYLER:  No, no.  Go.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, no, no.,MR. TYLER:  Go ahead.,Q    Michael, can you explain the president’s performance last night?  I know you’re focused on Trump and what he said, but the president himself, by all — he was unable to answer some questions, meandered, was clearly very different last night than he was this morning.  Can you just explain what happened and why — why he performed like that?,MR. TYLER:  Yeah, I think the president said it himself today.  You know, he didn’t have the best night on the debate stage.  But we’d rather have one bad night than a candidate with a bad vision for where he wants to take the country.,And, again, I think that’s what the American people saw in Donald Trump last night.  It’s certainly what they’re going to see with him as he returns to a MAGA rally in Virginia today.  They’re going to see exactly why they fired him in the first place as the — as he continues to be more and more in the limelight moving forward.,Q    And do you firmly reject any calls for the president to consider stepping aside or not running again?  Are there any conversations about that?,MR. TYLER:  There are no conversations about that whatsoever.  The Democratic voters elected — nominated Joe Biden.  Joe Biden is the nominee.  Joe Biden — and a couple of things I would point to about this too.,If you look at the actual — what we actually saw since the debate last night, we have seen, again, the president go to North Carolina, touch down, had thousands of supporters in the state of North Carolina rally around him.,But we also raised $14 million yesterday.  In fact, the 11:00  hour was our most successful grassroots fundraising hour of the entirety of the campaign.  That is Democratic voters tuning in, telling Joe Biden that they’ve got his back for the fight ahead because they understand that he’s fighting for them.,Q    And just a quick one.  Does the president commit to appearing at the debate in September?,MR. TYLER:  Oh, absolutely.  That’s what we laid out when we challenged Donald Trump to two debates.  Joe Biden will be there on September 10th.  We’ll see what Donald Trump does.,(Cross-talk.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Steve.  Go ahead, Steve.  Go ahead, Steve.,Q    Michael, what’s your assessment of all this criticism from fellow Democrats about his performance?,MR. TYLER:  Listen, I’ve also seen people — like Governor Shapiro, Governor Walz, Governor Whitmer, Speaker — Speaker-to-be Jeffries as well, who talked about the president who was on that debate stage, obviously, fighting for the American people and on the stage today in North Carolina demonstrating that he’s always going to get back up and continue to fight for the American people every single day and lay out the fundamental stakes of this election.,Are we going to have a president who fights for the American people, protects their freedoms, stands up for our democracy, fights for an economy that grows from the middle out and the bottom up?,Or are you going to have somebody like Donald Trump, who made it very clear on the debate stage last night, makes it very clear every single day on the stump that he is fighting for himself as a convicted felon?,He does not care about the harm that he causes, the chaos that he causes, the division or the violence that he sows so long as Donald Trump comes out on top.  That’s what the President called out today in North Carolina.  And that’s the choice that we’re going to continue to present to the American people going forward.,Q    Has the — has the president made any phone calls to fellow Democratic leaders trying to calm people down?,MR. TYLER:  I can’t — I can’t speak to that.,Yeah.,Q    And — and how is he —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.,Q    First, is the president sick?  And did that affect his preparation for the campaign?,MR. TYLER:  I know that the president did have a sore throat.,Q    But is he sick?  Does he have a cold?,MR. TYLER:  I think you saw the president today on the stage in North Carolina forcefully deliver remarks today.  So, it’s certainly not — the president would not cite his sore throat as an excuse for the debate performance.  He had a bad night.  He said that, right?  And it’s about how you get back up.  And that’s what we saw in North Carolina today.,Q    And — and would you — would you change the format for the next debate?  Or are you comfortable with — with the way C- — CNN conducted the debate?,MR. TYLER:  Listen, I — I think what you saw was Donald Trump get up there and lie to the American people.  And I think the American people, as we move forward, are going to see that as they see him in prime time over and over and over again.,So, what this campaign is focused on right now, on June 28th and as we move forward, is communicating directly with the American people not just what the president’s vision is for where — where he wants to take the country over the course of the next four years but, again, as people begin to understand the stakes and see Donald Trump back in the limelight, once again, reminding them of the lies, of the chaos that he sowed, of the division that he sowed, of the violence that he sowed.,That’s what they saw on the debate stage last night.  And that’s why they fired him four years ago.  So, we’re going to make sure that people continue to see that as we move into the summer months.,(Cross-talk.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.,Q    Is th- — is the strategy going to change at all now after this debate?  I mean, President Biden today said that he’s not as good — as good a debater as he once was.  He says he has a cold.  So, kind of, which is it?  And is — how is the strategy going to change going forward?,MR. TYLER:  Well, the strategy doesn’t change at all.  Our strategy, as I just said, moving forward is to relentlessly communicate directly with the American people between June 28th and November.,We are going to — the president right now — what did he do after he got off the debate stage?  He went straight to North Carolina to rally the troops here in the Tar Heel State, where the vice president is touching down in — out west in Nevada, doing the exact same thing right now.,We’re going to relentlessly communicate across the airwaves, on the ground.  We have 300 field offices that are opened up.  We’re going to relentlessly work to reach the voters that are going to decide the pathway to 270 electoral votes.,We have the candidate that beat Donald Trump in 2020.  We have the team that beat Donald Trump in 2020.  And we are confident that if we keep our heads down and do the work, the American people are once again going to side with Joe Biden.,Q    But age continues to be an issue for this campaign.  So, after last night, how — how could you not rethink some of the strategy here?,MR. TYLER:  Well, listen, age — the president himself has said it’s fair for the American people to consider age.  But what’s clear is that age is not going to be the contrast in this race.  Joe Biden is 81 years old.  Donald Trump is 78 years old.,Joe Biden, every single day, is fighting for an economy that actually works for working people.  That’s fundamentally what they’re going to vote on.  They’re going to vote about — on the issues.  They’re going to vote for the candidate who is actually fighting for them.,And it is very clear on all the issues that matter — from people’s economic weel- — well-being to which candidate is actually going to respect and restore a woman’s fundamental right to make her own choices about her body to defending and protecting our democracy — the only candidate fighting for them is Joe Biden.,Donald Trump, clearly fighting for himself and fighting against the American people on all those issues.,That’s what — that’s how the voters are going to fundamentally make their decision.,Q    Did you feel like the president performed differently in the debate prep?  Did you see any kind of difference?,MR. TYLER:  Listen, the president himself said he, you know, didn’t have the best night.  I think everybody understands that.  And what you saw him do today was to get right back up and carry on the fight.  That’s exactly what people in North Carolina saw.  That’s what people across America are going to see.  And that’s what we’re going to see in the days to come.,This — this is a president who understands that he’s never going to stop fighting for the American people, and that’s what we’ll continue to do.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Tyler.  We’re going to wrap it up.  Go ahead, Tyler.,Q    (Inaudible) million people watched the debate last night.  A lot fewer will have seen the president’s performance in North Carolina today.  So, how do you make up for that gap of the people who just saw the image last night and did not see the rally that you guys are excited about today?,MR. TYLER:  Yeah, that’s why you have a campaign: to relentlessly communicate the president, his vision, his message.  It’s not just the travel on the ground.  It’s not just on television.  It’s how we package and disseminate content.,I would actually look at a lot of the work that we did with content creators — not just last night but continuing to today.  We’re going to continue to — to communicate relentlessly and use all channels of communication to make sure that people actually see the fighter in Joe Biden who got up on that stage today and will do so in the weeks to come.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    A rally — a rally is vastly different than a debate.  So, back to, sort of, the strategy angle.  If they are going to have a second matchup in September, what is the actual strategic difference in preparation so that you have more of what happened today at the rally and less of what happened last night at the debate?,MR. TYLER:  Listen, we’ll talk more about the second debate as we get closer to the second debate.  What we’re focused on right now in — on June 28th is doing what we’re doing today: getting back out on the stump, communicating directly with the voters that are going to decide the election in the battleground states.,You have the president here in North Carolina — again, the vice president in Nevada — on the ground talking with the voters in those states that are going to decide this election.  I think you saw how North Carolinians responded to the president’s message and his vision today in North Carolina.  You’re going to see the same thing out west, where people get a chance to see Kamala Harris.,And that’s what our focus is going to be on — right? — directly engaging the voters, making sure that all of our organizers — we have over a thousand organizers across all the battleground states who are relentlessly doing the work on the ground.  Our paid advertisements continue to be aggressive.  They continue to — to outpace the work that Donald Trump is doing, who’s still — the vast majority of the money that his campaign is raising is still doing things like paying legal fees for somebody who’s now a convicted felon.  Right?  I think it’s in stark contrast.,Given the polarized electorate that we’re in, given the fact that both of these candidates are so well known, the work that the candidates and the campaigns are doing to turn out and organize their voters matters that much more.  And so, that’s what this campaign is going to be focused on as we head into the summer.,Q    One la- —,Q    Can you —,Q    One last thing.  Will you review how you do the debate preparation for — you know, m- — examine whether you need to do some things, need to do more things?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He just — he just —,MR. TYLER:  Again, I think I just answered that question.  I said we’d —,Q    I didn’t hear it.,MR. TYLER:  — think more — that’s okay.  We’d — we’ll — we’ll approach the second debate when we get closer to the second debate.  Our focus right now is on communicating directly with the voters.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, Darlene.  Last question.  Last question.,Q    Can you give us some details about the event tonight in New York City?,MR. TYLER:  I got nothing for you yet.,Q    Nothing?,MR. TYLER:  You’ll have to tune in.,Q    How is that possible?  (Laughter.),MR. TYLER:  I got — you all will just have to wait.  (Laughs.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Lauren, you have last question.,Q    Are you considering any staffing changes on the campaign after last night?,MR. TYLER:  Absolutely not.  This is the team that beat Donald Trump in 2020.  It’s the candidate to beat Jon- — Donald Trump in 2020.  And we’re going to beat him in 2024.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right, Tyler.  Really, really, really the last question.,Q    But there was an all-staff meeting today with the campaign.  What was the message that was sent to the —,MR. TYLER:  There was, but I was on the plane when it happened, so I have nothing to read out for you.,Q    Will the campaign focus on Virginia at all anymore?  I know Trump is in Southern Virginia.  Is that going to become a focus point —,MR. TYLER:  Yeah.,Q    — for the campaign?,MR. TYLER:  This campaign is focused on the path to 270 electoral votes and the tru- — and the battleground states.  I think that’s reflected in everything that we’re doing.  Today, we’re in North Carolina, we’re in Nevada.  I think that you’ve seen our path to victory, the states that we’re focused on that are actually going to decide the pathway to 270 electoral votes.,Donald Trump can do — I know he talks about rallies in New York City, for example.  But h- — we’re not going to allow him and his nonsense to distract us from what we know the task at hand needs to be.  We’re going to remain disciplined and do the work to get to 270 electoral votes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Thanks, everybody.,MR. TYLER:  All right, y’all.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks, Michael.,Q    Thank you.,MR. TYLER:  Thank you so much.  We will be doing this more often.,Q    Really appreciate it.,Q    Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, Michael.  Bye.,MR. TYLER:  Thanks, y’all.,Q    Appreciate it.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.,All right —,Q    Karine —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, that’s it.  Thanks, everybody.  (Laughter.),I don’t know what to say.  What else can I say?  (Inaudible.),Q    Can you tell us more about his cold?  When did he contract it?  What — did it affect his performance last night?,Q    Was he tested for COVID?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — okay, step back for a second.  So, yes, and I think we shared this with many people yesterday.  The president had a cold; he had a sore throat.  That happens.  And — and that’s what you heard last night.  And, you know, I’ll — I’ll leave it there.  I don’t have anything else to add.  I think Michael covered a lot of this just moments ago.,But, yes, he had a cold.  He had a sore throat.  Once he knew that he — he had a cold and a sore throat, he tested — he certainly tested for COVID.  It was negative.  And then we moved on from there.,Q    Why did the White House wait until the middle of the debate to release that information?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’ll tell you this.  Look, he had a strong debate-prep week.  And — and he got a cold, which happens.  It happens.  It’s not unusual.  It’s not something — you know — I mean, you don’t share every time, you know, the president has a cold.  It happened.  And once — once he had the cold and had a sore throat, again, he tested negative for COVID.  And then we moved on.,Q    But just curious about the disclosure of that information.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, he got a — I mean, Tyler, he got a cold.  It — it happens.,Q    But just in terms of when — the sequencing, like instead of before the debate, in the middle of the debate —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible.),Q    — how you decided —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, well —,Q    — when to announce —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — obviously, during the debate, we were asked if the president has a cold.  We — we said — well, they would — we were asked about his hoarse voice.  We shared that he had a cold, we shared that he tested negative, and then we moved on.  That’s it.  It was from his — his voice as he was speaking during the debate, obviously.,Q    Were there plans to let the public know if you weren’t received — if you weren’t, you know, asked from —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, he —,Q    — asked about it?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — had a cold.  It happens.  He had a cold.,Q    Right.  But you were — you were — during the debate, that was the blame for why he wasn’t doing well.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He had a hoarse voice, so people asked why he had a hoarse voice — because he had a cold.  And we also shared — we went a- — we went a step — we took a step further and shared that he tested for COVID and was negative.,I mean, he had a cold.  (Laughs.)  That’s what it was.,Q    Have you talked to the president?  How is he feeling w- — did you talk to him last night?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He —,Q    How he’s feeling —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I’m not going to — I’m not going to disclose my private conversations with the president.  Obviously — obviously, I — I speak to him often.,You saw him today.  You saw him — and I’m going to be super mindful.  Obviously, it was a camp- — it was a campaign event today.  But you saw him.  He — he spoke directly to the — to the American people.  You saw the crowd.  You saw what he laid out.  He li- — he laid out his vision for the future, what he’s done in the past three and a half years.  And that’s what I’ll stick to.,The other part, you can actually — obviously, you can speak — you can see for yourself.  But the president is a fighter.  He’s going to continue to fight for the American people, as he’s done the last three and a half years.  That doesn’t end.  That doesn’t stop.  And that’s what you’re h- — you’ll continue to hear from this president, as you saw today.,Q    Any reaction from him to the reaction to his performance last night?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I think the president — and I said this yesterday — the president always took — takes an opportunity — when he’s in front of an audience, when he knows that millions of Americans are going to tune in to hear directly from him, he’s going to take that opportunity to lay that out.,Yes, did he have a — a bit of a slow start?  You heard from the vice president last night, yes.  But as the time went on, he certainly made up some of that — right? — and mo- — mo- — probably faster than most would have and laid out his vision and was very clear about certain — certain parts of issues that the American people care about, whether it’s abortion, immigration, the things that you hear us talk about all the time, the contrast that we make with extreme Republicans and congressional members and what they’re trying to do on the other side.,And so — and you certainly heard that from him today.  And so, look, the president is going to always take the opportunity, again, to be very clear, to be very concise about what he’s doing on behalf of the American people.  There’ll be many, many opportunities.  We move on.  And you’ll hear more from the president, obviously, later today.,Q    What — was it ins- — personally insulting to him to have all these fellow Democrats come out and say, “You need to step aside”?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I’m not — you know, look, people are going to have their opinion.  I’m going to be very careful — right? — because this was a debate — the Hatch Act piece of that.,We respect — we respect, you know, our fellow — our fellow Democrats — obviously, part of our party — and their opinion.  But you heard — you heard Michael talk about the folks who were on — on TV today and earlier — earlier this morning talk about the president and his performance and how he’s a president that we need today.  He’s a president that’s going to continue to lead the way on really critical, important issues that Americans care about, that — truly, that Americans care about.,This week alone, we — we marked the Dobbs anniversary — right? — two years of when the former president put three extreme — extreme members on the court — individuals on the court, and they overturned Roe v. Wade.  And look what it’s caused.  It caused chaos with IVS [IVF], contraception.,And you have heard us — the president and the vice president continue to speak to that.  And we are with the majority of Americans, while, you know, extreme Republicans want to put national bans.,That’s what you’re going to continue to hear us fighting for: everyday Americans.  The economy — we understand how Americans are still feeling the pinch.,But what the president has done this last three and a half years is work to get the economy back on its feet.  And we see that with unemployment under 4 percent.  We see the — the amount of — record amount of jobs that this president has — able to be created — more than 15 million jobs.,And so, we’re going to — that’s going to be our focus.  Our focus is going to be how do we create, continue to provide that breathing room that you hear the president talk about for American people, fight for our freedom, fight for democracy.,And so, that’s — that is, I think, the contrast that you saw last night and what the president is going to do moving forward.,Q    Do you think the president does better or is more comfortable in moments that are scripted, like the rally earlier today, as opposed to the debate, when he has to think on his feet a bit more?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, you — I’m just going to repeat what the president said today.  He understands.,Look, he’s not as smooth as he used to be on the debate stage.  He doesn’t speak as smoothly as he used to be.  I mean, you heard him say and acknowledge — acknowledge where he is today.  And — and — but the thing that he ended with, which I think is so important, which I keep saying over and over to all of you, is he’s — he knows he’s going to fight for democracy.  He’s going to fight for freedom.  And he knows exactly how to do that.,And you see it with his record in the last three and a half years.  I think the record that he has been able to do — whether it’s legislation — historic pieces of legislation to get things done — I think that speaks for itself.  And so, this is a president that’s going to continue to do that — continue to do that.,Q    Karine —,Q    The Supreme Court Chevron ruling that came out today.,So much of the administration, you know, agenda is on — is around climate change.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    How big of a setback do you think this might be for some of the policies that —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, you may have seen I issued a — a statement —,Q    Yeah.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: — on this earlier, a respon- —,Q    (Inaudible.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,So, I’ll just say a little bit.  This is yet another troubling decision that takes our country backwards.  Republican-backed special interests have repeatedly turned to the Supreme Court to block common-sense rules that keep us safe, protect our health and environment, safeguard our financial system, and support American consumers and workers.,The president has directed his legal team to work with Department of Justice and other agency counsel to review today’s decision carefully and ensure that our administration is doing everything we can to continue to deploy the extraordinary expertise of the federal workers to keep Americans safe and ensure our communities thrive and prosper.,Q    And what about the Supreme Court ruling about the Justice Department overstepping on charging hundreds of people for the —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, that one, I’m going to be super mindful — I’m going to refer you to Department of Justice.  As you know, they’re ongoing cases.  So, I just got to be super careful on that.  That litigation continues.,Go ahead.,Q    Karine, the — three U.S. troops died in Jordan this year and more in Afghanistan in 2021.  How can the president say none have died during his administration?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, obviously, the president, as you know, is the commander in chief.  And you hear him even when he ends every — ev- — all of his remarks, he talks about respecting — respecting our — our troops who are serving today.  And he con- — he will always do that and continues to do that.  And he obviously had — his son was — was — obviously served, as well.  So, this is something that he respects.  And so, I don’t think — I don’t think that will ever change.,Obviously, our hearts and our thoughts go out to the family who are pro- — clearly still suffering and thinking about their loved ones.  And so, we’ll continue to do that.,And I — you know, I refer you to the campaign about specifics about fact-checking and all of those pieces.  But I can speak to a president that has been incredibly respectful of the military and what they do for us day in and day out and how they continue to serve our country.,You saw th- — you saw that on display, obviously, on D-Day when he was in Normandy — he did that twice — and honoring those who have fallen.  And so, he’ll continue to do that.,Any particular fact-check, I would certainly refer you to the campaign",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Q    Well, I understand that that was said during debate, so that we can — can refer to the campaign.  But he is the president.  This — these weren’t off-the-cuff remarks.  They felt prepared.  And it was clearly a mistake.  Does he not consider these to be —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, what I will say is the president respects our military force.  He respects the families who have lost members of the military.  He will continue to do that.  He has been very consistent about that — not just as president but as vice president, as senator.  You hear him talk about the service and how they put their lives on the — on the line every single day to protect us.  He t- — he always ends his remarks mentioning that, mentioning and lifting up our service members.  And that’s what I will speak to at this time.,All right, guys.,Q    Thank you.,Q    Thanks, Karine.,MS.

PDT,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Norma!  (Applause.)  Dr. Norma — can we hear it for her?  (Applause.),Oh.  (Laughs.),AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Four more years.,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That’s right.  That’s right.,Thank you all.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.,It is so good to be back in Nevada.  And thank you all — all the leaders who are here.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.,And can we please hear it for Dr. Norma and her extraordinary life and leadership, please.  (Applause.),So, I want to thank everyone who is here today.  I want to thank all the elected leaders who are here.,I know Senator Catherine Cortez Masto was here earlier.  She and I were AGs together.  She is doing an extraordinary job as a senator.,Senator Mark Kelly, who is just always fighting for the people of Nevada and using his lifelong dedication to our country in a way that is about service and uplifting so many people.,Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, thank you for your leadership.  (Applause.),And, of course, Senator Jacky Rosen, who we will reelect — (applause) — this November.,And on behalf of my husband — (laughs) — (applause) — the second gentleman of the United States — (laughs) — we together thank all the friends and the long-standing supporters who are here, including the leaders of LULAC.  It is so good — (applause) — it is so good to be with all of you.,All right.  So, last night, President Joe Biden and Donald Trump had their first debate.  And earlier today, the president said himself it was not his best performance.  But there are three things that were true yesterday before the debate that are still true today.,Let’s level set on this.  All right?,First, the stakes of this race could not be higher.  (Applause.)  Second, the contrast in this election could not be more stark.  (Applause.)  And third, we believe in our president, Joe Biden, and we believe in what he stands for.  (Applause.),That’s right.  That’s right.  That’s right.,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Four more years!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And to that point, we all know — let’s not forget — he beat Donald Trump once.  And in Nevada, with your help, we’re going to do it again.  (Applause.),And we’re going to win because, for all the punditry last night, for all of that, our president made clear there is a contrast between someone who lies and someone who leads.  (Applause.),Let’s start with the thing we have always known.  Donald Trump is unburdened by the truth.  It’s not a burden he carries.  Case in point: last night, a nonstop stream of lies.,He said the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville was, quote, “fabricated.”,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let us speak the truth.  That’s a lie.,He said the mob he incited at the United States Capitol on January 6th was only a, quote, “small number of people,” who were, quote, “ushered in by the police” — a lie.,He claimed he never called our troops “suckers” and “losers.”  As General John Kelly — General John Kelly, his former chief of staff, can tell you, another lie.,Friends, most of us agree: In a real leader, character matters more than style.  (Applause.)  And Donald Trump simply does not have the character to be president of the United States.  (Applause.),For further context, consider: More than 20 of his former top leaders, from his former Secretary of Defense to his National Security Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, have spoken out against Trump.,And note, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, only one candidate on that stage has the endorsement of his own vice president — (laughs) — (applause) — Joe Biden.  And former Vice President Pence is evidently not supporting a second term for Trump because he knows Trump is a threat to our democracy and he only fights for himself, not you.,Now some of you might remember that recently, when Donald Trump was here in Las Vegas, in 104-degree heat, he told a crowd, quote, “I don’t care about you.  I just want your vote.”  Well, that’s about the only thing he’s said lately that rings true.  (Laughter and applause.),Nevada, as vice president, I see Joe Biden when the cameras are on and when the cameras are off; in the Oval Office, negotiating bipartisan deals.  I see him in the Situation Room, keeping our country safe; on the world stage, meeting with foreign leaders who often ask for his advice.,Joe Biden is a leader who always fights for the people of our nation.  (Applause.)  He fights, and he wins.  And he wins.  (Applause.)  And he wins.,Think about it.  Think about it in terms of who our president is.  Guided — guided by the knowledge that Latinos are 70 percent more likely to have diabetes, Joe Biden took on Big Pharma and capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month.  He negotiated with Republicans and Democrats and passed historic legislation: the largest infrastructure investment in generations and the first major gun safety law in nearly 30 years.  And Las Vegas knows why that is important.  (Applause.)  He strengthened NATO and stood up to Putin, bringing together our allies around the world.,Nevada, last night clarified the stakes of this election.  On the economy, Joe Biden pointed out how economists, including Nobel Prize-winning economists, have determined — check this out — have determined Trump’s economic plans going forward would raise inflation and send us into a recession by 2025.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  This is their findings based on reviewing his plans.,On democracy, last night, Donald Trump repeatedly refused to commit to agree he would accept the results of the 2024 election.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And finally, on the subject of reproductive freedom, last night, Trump called the overturning of Roe v. Wade a, quote, “great thing.”,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And as President Biden has said, we know Trump will sign a national abortion ban if he gets the chance.  But we won’t let him.  We won’t let him — (applause) — because we trust women to know what is in their own best interest as opposed to having their government tell them what to do with their bodies.  (Applause.),So, listen, we’ve got 130 days — I’m counting — (laughter) — until election day — 130 days.  And this race will not be decided by one night in June.  This race will be decided by you, by us.  Who sits in the White House next year will be determined by what we, together, do in these next 130 days.,And ultimately, in this election, we each face a question: What kind of country do we want to live in — a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We each have the power — each of us has the power to answer this question with our vote and with our voice.,So, today, I ask, Nevada, are you ready to make your voices heard?  (Applause.),Do we believe in freedom?  (Applause.),Do we believe in opportunity?  (Applause.),Do we believe in the promise of America?  (Applause.),And are we ready to fight for it?  (Applause.),And when we fight —,AUDIENCE:  We win!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we win!,God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.,Thank you all.  (Applause.),END                 12:20 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Manhattan Center,New York, New York,9:06 P.M. EDT,THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.),Whoa!  Thank you.  (Applause.),What a crowd.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you.,Folks — (applause) — I think I should leave now.  (Laughter.)  Please have a seat.  Thank you.,Thank you for that introduction, Elton.  But more importantly, thank you for your friendship.  Like so many members of the American family, our family loves your music, admires your courage and advocacy for equality.  And you do incredible family work, man.  And your sons, David — you know, with your — with your husband, David, and your sons.,Two years ago, Jill and I were honored to host you at the White House and bestow on this man the National Humanities Medal, one of America’s highest awards.  Today, we’re honored to be with you again here — earlier at Stonewall and here tonight.,Folks, we’re honored to celebrate 25 years of the LGBTQ Leadership Council.  (Applause.)  And thanks to council co-chairs Andy Tobias, an old friend, and Dr. Claire Lucas and Bruce Cohen — (applause) — for your hard work on this event and all the events and all the hosts that are chairing this for us.,And I want to thank the DNC Chair Jaime Harrison.  (Applause.)  You see him any- — he loo- — he’s looking awful spiffy tonight, man.,It’s wonderful to see many — so many friends and leaders, activists, trailblazers all across this country, including Sarah McBride of Delaware who is soon going to become — (applause) — likely to make history this election — she used to work with my son Beau — she’s elect- — when she gets elected to Congress from the state of Delaware.  (Applause.),And special thanks to Pete and Chasten Buttigieg.  (Applause.)  They are first-rate people, man.  I’m lucky to have them.,Folks, the stakes couldn’t be higher, and the choice couldn’t be clearer.  Literally, freedom, democracy, America itself is on the ballot.  And I’m going to protect freedom, democracy, and America, and Donald Trump will not.  That’s especially the case when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community.,In fact, earlier today, Jill and I visited Stonewall Inn to unveil the new visitor center, the country’s first ever within the National Park System to honor the LGBTQ community.  This senator — (applause) — this center will be a source of education, art, and inspiration that preserves how history and legacy of Stonewall Uprising has been preserved.  And it signifies the legacy of the leadership of the LGBT community, especially trans women of coldor — color — (applause) — who, for generations, have been at the forefront of helping realize the promise of America for all Americans.,Folks, not only that — earlier this week, Jill hosted a big Pride Month celebration at the White House with my daughter, Ashley.  (Applause.)  While they couldn’t be here, I want to thank our dear friends Tim Gill and Scott Miller for helping make that happen.  (Applause.),These events are all part of my administration’s commitment to the most pro-equality administration in history.  And I’m so grateful to lead an American gener- — administration that looks and acts like America, and proud — proud staff at every level.  (Applause.)  LGBTQ nominees confirmed to the federal bench — at this point, more than any other president in American history.  (Applause.),But that’s not all.  I know, back in 2012, I made some news on “Meet the Press” in an interview — (applause) — when I was asked about marriage equality.  All I could think of was what my dad taught me.,I remember my dad was dropping me off to get a license in the city of Wilmington, and we — and I w- — getting out in the — what they call Rodney Square, where the DuPont, Hercules, and all these major corporations were centered.  And two well-dressed men on the corner, as I was getting out of the car, leaned down and kissed one another and went off their separate ways.  I looked at my dad.  My dad said something very basic.  He said, “Joey, it’s simple.  They love each other.  It’s simple.  They love each other.”,When I was vice president — (applause) — I remember calling Jim Oberfell when he was on the steps of the Supreme Court after the marriage equality was upheld.  And with you, I signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law, protecting marriage of same-sex and racial (inaudible) couples.  (Applause.),Our administration is strengthening civil rights protections in the classroom, on the playing field and at work, and in our housing and health care systems.  We’re combating the dangerous, cruel practice of so-called “conversion therapy.”  My —,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  You can say that again.  That deserves more than a boo.,My administration launched a new national strategy to end HIV s- — and the cause that Elton John led himself by sheer will for so long.  And we’ve also worked with c- — communities to treat and to contain the mpox outbreak.,And we ended the disgraceful practice of banning gay and bisexual men from donating blood that was mentioned already.  (Applause.)  We’re making human rights for LGBTQ people around the world a top priority for our foreign policy, not just at home.  (Applause.),We ended Trump’s ban on transgender Americans serving in the military, which has also been mentioned.  And just last week, I was proud to correct a historical injustice by pardoning veterans who were court-martialed and dishonorably discharged for the crime of simply being themselves.  (Applause.),And that’s a big deal in the making.  This pardon will open the door to LGBTQ veterans and their families receiving long-overdue benefits and so much more.  These are heroes who saved our nation, deserve to be honored.,I’ve also had the honor of meeting survivors of the,Q Club,[Club Q] and the Pulse shootings, who remind us of why we must fully implement a significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years that I signed.  (Applause.)  And we must come back and ban assault weapons.  (Applause.)  Universal background checks.  (Applause.),And for all the progress, we know — we know the perils are real.  When a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, something is still very wrong in America.  That’s why Congress must pass the Equality Act — (applause) — and codify protections for,LGBQ,[LGBTQ] Americans.,We must act when families across the country flee the excruciary dec- — the excruciating decision to relocate in different states to protect their child from dangerous anti-LGBTQ laws, like Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” law.  It’s a disgrace.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  We’re pushing back against hundreds of callous Republican bills and laws introduced in states targeting transgender children, terrifying families, criminalizing doctors and nurses.  We’re deploying more security resources, taking on civil rights violations, increasing mental health resources for LGBTQ kids.  This matters.  It matters.,Let there be no doubt: I will continue to defend your freedoms.  (Applause.)  Trump has committed to roll back all the progress and protections if he’s elected again.,So, let’s also be clear: Donald Trump brags about getting Roe v. Wade overturned.  It not only took away reproductive rights — the Dobbs decision — but he also has risk of broader privacy rights for everyone, because the fundamental right of privacy, which Roe recognized, has served as a basis for so many other rights that are part of the fabric of the country — fundamental rights.,Justice Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in Dobbs  that in future cases, the court should reconsider all its due — substantive due process precedents, from Griswold to Lawrence.  That means everything from the right to contraception to LGBQ- — LGBQ- — -TQ equality.  I’m serious.  (Applause.)  And it even — even access to IVF is under threat across the country.  It’s outrageous.,Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are attacking the most basic values and freedoms as Americans: the right to be yourself, the right to make your own health decisions, the right to marry the person you love, the right to raise your own children.  (Applause.),Folks, let’s be clear: The Supreme Court is on the ballot this Septem- — this t- — November — (applause) — because the next president of the United States is likely to be able to appoint two or more Supreme Court justices in the next term.  We can’t allow Trump to nominate more justices, the impact — which would impact the next 30, 40, 50 years of this nation.,Folks, I know it takes courage to face this kind of relentless hate and discrimination.  So, tonight I want to send a message to the entire LGBTQ community, especially transgender children: You belong.  You’re loved.  (Applause.)  You belong, and you’re loved.  And I mean it.,Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, our entire administration will always have your back.  Always.  (Applause.)  We see who you are, equally deserving of dignity and respect and support.,Although [there] are those who want to ban books and try to erase history, together we’re going to make more history — more history.  (Applause.),Folks, let me close with this.  I know I may not look it, but I’ve been around a while.  (Laughter.)  My career — in my career, I’ve been told I’m too young, being elected at 29 — the second-youngest man in history in history to be elected to the Senate — and I’m too old.,But whether young or old, here’s what I know.  I know how to tell the truth.  (Applause.),I know right from wrong.  I know how to do this job.  (Applause.),I know how to get things done.  (Applause.),And I know, like millions of Americans who know, when you get knocked down, you get back up.  (Applause.),Folks, I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul that I can do this job, because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.  Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this nation.  He’s a threat to our freedom, he’s a threat to our democracy, and he’s a literally a threat to all we stand for as a nation.,He doesn’t understand what I think we all do: that America is unique in the world.  We’re the — that’s not a he- — exaggeration.  We’re unique in the world.  We’re the only nation built on an idea.  Every nation is — is built on ethnicity or l- — geography.  We’re the only nation created — and we all believe — that we believe all people deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.  (Applause.),We’ve never fully lived up to it, but I’ll be damned if in 20- — 2024, just two years before the 250 anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, I’ll let Donald Trump get away with it.  (Applause.),He talks about us like we’re a third-world nation.  This is a nation that believes in honesty, decency, treating people with respect.  We’re still a nation that gives everyone a fair shot and leaves no one behind.  We’re still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor.  And we’re still a nation that’s a beacon to the rest of the world.  We can never give up on what makes America, America.,Donald Trump is motivated, as mentioned earlier, by hate and revenge and retribution.  Well, revenge and retribution never built a damn thing.  (Applause.),But I’ll tell you what has: hope, optimism, possibilities.  That’s what always built America, and that’s what I — we will continue to do in America today: build hope — hope.,The choice in this election is quite simple.  Donald Trump will destroy our democracy.  That’s not hyperbole.  I said that when I ran the first time.  He’s a greater threat today than he was then.  I will defend democracy.,So, folks, are you with me?  (Applause.),You know, I’m accused — I’m accused of being a —,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  Years ago — years ago, I had an aneurism, and I remember being wheeled down by the docs into the operating room.  I said, “What are my chances?”  He said, “They’re pretty good, Senator.”  I was a senator then.  He said, “They’re somewhere around 30 percent.”  (Laughter.)  I said, “Well, that’s good.  Three out of ten, I’m going to make it.”,And he looked at me afterwards, all — it was all over — he said, “You know your problem, Senator?”  He said, “You’re a congenital optimist.”  (Laughter.),I am a congenital optimist, and I’ve never been more optimistic about our future.  We just have to — we just have to proudly remember who we are.  We’re the United States of America, for God’s sake.  There is nothing — nothing beyond our capacity when we act together.,So, God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  (Applause.),You’re the best in the world.  I’m with you.  I’m with you, I promise you.  (Applause.),God love you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.,Thank you.  Thank you.,I didn’t see you all up there.  Don’t jump!,Thank you, thank you, thank you.  God love you.,We’re going to do this.  We’re going to do this.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.),9:22 P.M.

There you are, the senator from the great state of California.  (Laughs.),Representative Brad Sherman, where are you?  There he is.  (Applause.)  Thank you for allowing us to be in your district.  (Laughs.),And I know Idina Menzel is coming up later, and I want to thank her in advance for her incredible gift.,All right, so, listen: 129 days until the election — 129 days.  We can do anything in 129 days.  So, it’s a short time, and it’s going to be a long time.  And I know that each one of us is dedicated to spending each and every one of these next 129 days to do everything that we know is in our power to fight for this country we love.,I was saying to a group of the host earlier, this — we know what’s in front of us in terms of the split screen and who — the guy on the other side.  But let’s not get so caught up in that that we forget that this is not a fight against something; this is a fight for something.,We love our country.  We believe in the promise of America.  As much as anything, the fight before us is for the promise of America.  I am empirical evidence of the promise of America, okay?  (Applause.)  We know what can happen and what is possible when we collectively have the ability to see what can be unburdened by what has been.,After all, that’s what we’re celebrating on the 11th anniversary is our collective knowledge, forever, of what was possible 11,days,[years] ago and then fighting to get there.  We were fighting for something: the promise of America.  We believe in those foundational principles that include the promise of freedom and liberty and equality and justice.,Isn’t that why we’re all here together right now?  This is — this is an ongoing fight.  (Applause.)  This is an ongoing fight.  And this is one of the most critical phases of that fight we’ve all been in for a very long time.,And because we’ve been in the fight before, I say with full confidence, we will win.  We will win.  (Applause.)  We know what we stand for, so we know what to fight for.  And when we fight, we win.  (Applause.),So, everybody, get your head on straight — (laughter) — okay?,And with that, I’ll deal with the elephant in the room.  I’m going to do with two elephants, actually.  (Laughter.),But the debate — the debate.  Our president said it wasn’t his finest hour.  We all know it wasn’t.  But we also know that when we watched and listened to the substance of what was happening on that debate stage, if we put aside the style points, there was a clear contrast.,On the one side, you have somebody — as Rob has said, has proven and been proven in a court of law — says the former prosecutor — to have been found beyond a reasonable doubt.  Where are you, Boutrous?  Right? (Applause.)  You have someone in the former president of the United States, who openly talks about his admiration for dictators and said he’ll be a dictator on “day one.”  Someone who has said openly how he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies.,None of that has changed because of one day in June.,Four things remain true before that debate and after that debate: The stakes are higher than they’ve ever been.  This person is a threat to our democracy.  We have all of the right issues on our side, in terms of what we are fighting for.  And you know the fourth thing that remains true before the debate and after debate?  Trump is still a liar.  (Applause.),You see how much hasn’t changed?  (Laughs.)  So, let’s deal with what we’ve got, right?  Let’s deal with what we’ve got.,We’re in a fight.  We know that this fight is based on so many key points about what is happening in our nation now.,There’s — I’ve been traveling our country.  You know a- — my staff has told me that, already this year, just this year, I’ve already been to 60 dif- — over 60 trips.  I’ve been spending time in all the states around our country and, in particular, the battleground states.,Roy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina, he’s very funny; every time he meets me on the tarmac, when I arrive in North Carolina, and he will tell me each time — I think he told me last time I was there this was my 14th trip as vice president to North Carolina.,So, let me just say, I’m in these streets.  (Laughter.)  I’m in these streets, okay?  (Applause.)  And I will tell you what the streets are saying.,People care deeply about fighting for fundamental freedoms.  They care deeply about having leadership in our country that reflects our values and our mores and what we admire, not what we despise.,The American people know that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down.  It’s based on who you lift up.,The American people know that the true character, the strength of character of a leader is based on someone who has some level of concern and care about the well-being of other people and then does something about it to lift their condition.,As I travel our country, I am in small and extremely large groups of people.  Let me tell you what they say to me: “Thank you for capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for our seniors.”  Because, you see, they will say, “You know, vice president, but you will hear from me: Black people are 60 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes; Latinos are 70 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.  For too long, our seniors have had to make a decision about whether they could afford to fill their prescription for insulin or fill their refrigerator.  And you capping that cost of insulin is life-changing, game-changing for the people in my family.”  That’s what people will tell me.,They will say, “Thank you.  Finally, an administration took on Big Pharma and is allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices so that seniors’ medication will be capped at $2,000 a year.”  “Thank you,” they say.,They say — (applause) — I have teachers coming up to me, not to mention all kinds of folks — firefighters, nurses — who say, “Thank you guys for the student loan debt relief, because you don’t understand the burden that we have been carrying, tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, that are finally being forgiven.”  God knows we don’t pay our teachers enough as it is.,They thank us, and they say, “Finally, you see the people and understand an issue like medical debt.”,What am I talking about?  Well, medical debt is burdening — if you talk about demographics — substantial percentages of the people of our country — medical debt — which most usually comes about because someone suffers a medical emergency.  So, then, obviously not planned, not invited.  And they accrue tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, which can be used in their credit score to deny them eligibility for a car loan, a lease for an apartment.  And they say, “Thank you, because you all finally said medical debt cannot be counted against my credit score.”  (Applause.),I started a college tour last fall.  I decided, you know what, I — I love getting out of D.C.  And — and, in particular, I have to tell you, I love Gen Z.  I love Gen Z.  I know it’s complicated if you have Gen Z in your life, but I’m going to tell you.,And, okay, it’s going to be a humbling fact for everyone here.  Do you know what year someone was born if they’re 18 today?  2006.  (Laughter.)  That’s humbling. (Laughs.),So, I started this college tour, and I went to various schools.  And, actually, it was college-aged young people, so I — colleges, universities, but also trade schools.  And I would talk with them abou- — because I would listen to them, Gen Z.  Think about their life experience.  Some of the most critical issues before us in this election are a lived experience for them.,They’ve only known the climate crisis.  They have coined a term, “climate anxiety,” to describe their fear of having children or aspiring to buy a home for fear it could be wiped out with extreme weather.,They witnessed the killing of George Floyd.,The pandemic made them lose substantial phases of their education and socialization.,In the height of their reproductive years, the court just took a fundamental right.,And on the issue of gun violence, I will share with you: In every auditorium, which was packed to the point that we had overflow room — now, can you imagine a bunch of college students who — this is not a rock concert — would actually stand in line for these hours and overflow room to see a vice president in a suit on a stage talking?  I’d ask every room, “Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade you had to endure an active shooter drill?”  Almost every hand went up.  It was bone-chilling.,So, on the issue of climate, where our administration, through the Inflation Reduction Act, has dropped about a trillion dollars, by my math, over the next 10 years in investing in a clean energy economy and resilience and adaptation, and also challenging our allies and others around the world to now put up, because we just have.,Whether it is on an issue like gun violence, where we passed the first meaningful gun safety law in 30 years in our country.,Whether it is on the issue of choice, where, as you all know, we’re very clear.,On any one of these issues, the American people, when I am in the streets, talk about their support for our perspective and their desire and need for us to fight for these issues.,So, I bring you back my notes from the field to remind us all of what we know: There is so much at stake, and what we did in 2022 to elect Joe Biden president united states and me the first woman vice president of the United States — (applause) — what we did in terms of what that meant, in terms of what we can accomplish and did.,So, when we say the stakes are high, yes, it is about this overt, clear threat to our democracy.  And the stakes are high because we actually need to get some shit done.  (Applause.)  And we know how to do it.  And we know how to do it.,Because, by the way, the other side has no plan, except to try and divide our nation and spew hate.,And that brings me to the point of our celebration today of what we collectively did 11 years ago.  I think about that day — and I heard — Chad, I heard you telling the story.  I — so, I was in my — so — well, first of all, I — I have two things to celebrate, which is, one, that the — I was one of the first in the country and inclu- — of any elected to perform same-sex marriages on Valentine’s weekend in 2004.  (Applause.)  And so, we just a few months ago celebrated the 20th anniversary of that.  And — and then 11 years ago.,And I remember, because I got the call from Chad.  You were on the plane.  You guys were coming back from D.C. after the decision.  And my office in San Francisco was — for those who know San Francisco, was up on Golden Gate, on the street.  And so, it was about two and a half blocks from City Hall, which is where we were going to meet up.  And I had security then and, you know, they said, “Well, ma’am, you know, we should drive.  We drive everywhere.”  And I was like, “Nope.”  (Laughter.)  Because I had in my mind that photograph of Thurgood.  Have you all ever seen that photograph of him walking, right?  (Laughter.)  And I was like, “No, we’re walking to City Hall, me and my team.”  (Laughs.)  (Applause.),And we walked to City Hall.  And it was incredible, because we got there and n- — lots of people didn’t yet know what had happened.  And so, we get there and — and Chad told the story about the call that I made to the clerk in Los Angeles.  But when we arrived, it was quiet and — and the place seemed empty.  And we were there, and then slowly the folks who knew started to gather.  And then — do you remember?   And I think it might have been before you landed.  And then, all of the sudden, out of nowhere, appeared the Gay Men’s Chorus.  (Laughter.)  And just seemingly out of nowhere, they arrived at City Hall and started tuning up.  And it was — (laughs) — and it was just layer after layer after layer of pure joy and pride 11 years ago.,So, let’s hold onto those kinds of days to remind ourselves of what we stand for and why we fight.  Because there are so many here who can testify and give the testimonials about the heartache and pain that for years went into this movement, which is not over yet.  We still need to pass the Equality Act.,We still need to deal with what’s happening in terms of people who are trying to turn back the clock, like a “Don’t Say Gay” bill in Florida.  You know, I think about that Chad — so, 20 years ago, performed same-sex marriages, and then I think about some young teachers in Florida, who are probably in their 20s, who are afraid to put up a photograph of themselves and their partner for fear they could lose their job.  Their job being what?  God’s work: teaching other people’s children.,And so, thinking about how the clock people are trying to rollback, knowing what we are fighting for now, but also remembering the joy that comes with the product of that struggle — let’s remember all of that.  Let’s remember all of that.,Many of you may know, my first campaign manager — when I first ran for district attorney of San Francisco, nobody thought we could win.  I started out at six points in the polls, which, if anyone doesn’t know, that means six out of 100.  (Laughter.)  I knew when we got to 12, we could win.,And my first campaign manager was — God rest his soul — a man by the name of Jim Rivaldo.  Jim Rivaldo was Harvey Milk’s campaign manager.  And Jim and I spent — and my mother actually took care of Jim as he was dying.  He actually ha- — ended up having AIDS.  But Jim would talk to me — and I never met Harvey; that was before my time.  But — but Jim would talk about the movement in the early days.  And San Francisco, of course, takes great pride in being a birthplace of the movement.  And he would talk about how Harvey and he and the leaders at that time thought about what the movement would require for success.,And they talked about it in the context — and he, in particular — of the importance of building community and reminding and remembering that the forces against progress — I don’t say change; I say progress — will always try to demean and belittle and suggest to people that they’re — by themselves, are somehow subversive in trying to undo what should be the values of America.  And he would talk about — understand that’s — that’s the pathology of it all.  That’s how it works.  That’s what they do.,And so, we, in these movements for progress, must be intentional about building community and reminding people they are not alone and building coalitions.,And I think often about Rivaldo in this moment, as I have throughout my career.,I asked my team — so, okay, one of the things that I — I do about a lot of things, I — I love Venn diagrams, let me just tell you.  I love Venn di — I — I’m a nerd.  I love Venn diagrams.  If ever you are facing conflict, throw up a Venn diagram.  It will help you sort it out, just those three circles.  (Laughter.),So, I asked my team: Let’s do a Venn diagram.  Show me from which states are we seeing attacks on LGBT- — that was so funny, Rob.  LGB- — the “Q” and the “plus” weren’t even around then.  (Laughter.),LGBTQ+ rights — where are the attacks coming from on that?  Where are the attacks coming from on voting rights?  Where are the attacks coming from on reproductive freedoms?  No one here would be surprised to know: complete — almost complete overlap, coming from the same places.,Full-on attack on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and rights: freedom to have access to the ballot box, freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, freedom to live free from fear of hate and bigotry, freedom to make decisions about your own body and not have your government tell you what to do.  This is what we are seeing.  (Applause.),And in these moments, then, I think about Rivaldo.  And I think, “Hey, let’s — let’s see the opportunity in this crisis to build our coalition up.”  All those folks who have been fighting for voting rights, all those folks who have been fighting for reproductive freedom and maternal health care, all the folks who have been in our movement fighting for LGBTQ+ rights — let’s bring everybody together.,We’re in the middle of a movement.  And the next inflection point in our movement will be this election.  But what we know, in any movement that is about freedom and liberty, is we stand on broad shoulders of the folks who came before us, and we are sitting here — right now, together — because they passed us the baton in this relay race of history.,And the question is going to be: While we are carrying the baton, what will we do with it?  And I have full confidence in the answer to that question.,This election is going to be about what kind of country do we want to live in.  We love our country.  We know what kind of country we want to live in.,And I’ll end with this.  When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.,And when we fight, we win.

they look to us.  They look to us, and it’s part of our foreign policy as well now.,This beloved bar became the site of a call to cry for freedom, dignity, and equality and respect — a rebellion that galvani- — galvanized the LBGTQ+ community all across the nation and, quite frankly, around the world.  You — I — I mean, you’d be amazed the number of places I am, whether its India or other places, where people talk about the gay movement here in the United States of America.  I mean it.,You marked a turning point in civil rights in America.  You inspired the hearts of millions of people around the world.  To this day, Stonewall remains a symbol of the legacy and leadership of the LGBTQ+ community, especially trans women of color — (applause) — who, for generations, have been at the forefront of helping realize the promise of America for all Americans.,Look, in 2016, President Obama — I was his vice president at the time — designated Christopher Park as a national monument.  Today, I am proud to unveil a new visitor center for Stonewall National Monument, the first-ever LGBTQ+ visitor center in the national parks of America.  (Applause.)  And it matters.  It matters.,We remain in a battle for the soul of America.  I know I’ve said that for a while now.  People looked at me when I first said it like I was kidding.  I’m not.  We’re in the battle for the soul of America.,But I look around at the pride, hope, and light that all of you — all of you bring, and I know it’s a battle we’re going to win and continue to make progress.,LGBTQ+ people are some of the most inspiring people I know.  And, of course, the courage — you know, I — I talk to a lot of younger LGBT- — LGBTQ people, in their teens and 20s, and I remind them: For a lot of people who started this operation, you took your life in your own hands — not figuratively, literally.  You took your jobs in your own hands.  You were put up in a position where you were — so much to lose, and you still did it.  You still did it.,I remember my dad was dropping me off to get a license to be a lifeguard in Wilmington, Delaware, at a swimming pools.  And I got out of the car in Rodney Square, they called.  And there’s a — that’s where the DuPont Building is and the Hercules Corporation — all in that one quarter.,And two well-dressed men were kissing each other.  And I hadn’t seen that before.  I looked at my dad.  I was 16 years old.  I looked at my dad, and he said, “It’s simple, Joey.  They love each other.  It’s simple.”  (Applause.),He was a good man.,And your courage and contributions enrich every part of American life.  You set an example — I’m not exaggerating — for the entire world.  That’s what this center, this monument, this month is all about.,So, today, let’s proudly remember who we are.  We’re the United States of America.  And there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we work together, and everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, no matter what their background, period, period, period.  (Applause.),As you can tell, I want to say a hell of a lot more, but I’m not going to — (laughter) — because I want to hear a guy you — you know, there’s a guy that you’ve probably heard about.  He’s a dear friend.  A guy’s, like so many Americans, whose family loves this iconic music — my family loves it.  And, of course, his incredible music career.  He also empowered countless people to be themselves, to be treated with dignity and respect they deserve, including those in the fight against HIV/A- — H- — HIV/AIDS, a fight he led with sheer willpower.,Two years ago, Jill and I had the honor to host him in the White House and bestow on him the National Humanitarian Med- — Humanities Medal, one of America’s highest awards.,So, today, we’re honored to be with him again here at Stonewall.,Please welcome Elton John.  (Applause.),4:55 P.M.

This investment is part of the,Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a,first-of-its-kind and national-scale $27 billion program funded through President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act,to combat the climate crisis by catalyzing public and private capital for projects that slash harmful climate pollution, improve air quality, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs. This program will ensure communities across the country have access to the capital they need to participate in and benefit from a cleaner, more sustainable economy.,Vice President Kamala Harris and EPA Administrator Michael Regan will be joined by Governor Roy Cooper, Mayor Vi Lyles, and Congresswoman Alma Adams to announce the selections under these two grant competitions in Charlotte, North Carolina.,This historic investment will support a wide range of climate and clean energy projects, including distributed clean power generation and storage, net-zero retrofits of homes and small businesses, and zero-emission transportation, all of which can lower energy costs for families and improve housing affordability while tackling the climate crisis. Collectively, the selected applicants have committed to,reducing or avoiding up to 40 million metric tons of carbon pollution annually over the next seven years,, contributing toward the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic climate goals. In addition, selectees plan to,mobilize almost $7,of private capital for every $1 of federal funds,—,approximately $150 billion total,—ensuring that today’s awards will have a catalytic, ongoing effect on the deployment of climate and clean energy technologies at scale, particularly in underserved communities.,The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program advances the Biden-Harris Administration’s,Justice40 Initiative,, which sets the goal that 40% of the overall benefits from certain federal climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.,At least,70% of the funds announced today—,over $14 billion of capital—will be invested in low-income and disadvantaged communities,, including historic energy communities that have powered our nation for over a century, communities with environmental justice concerns, communities of color, low-income communities, rural communities, Tribal communities, and more. This makes the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund the,single,largest non-tax investment within the Inflation Reduction Act to build a clean energy economy while benefiting communities historically left behind.,Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are already attempting to roll back these historic investments. Last month, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1023, which would repeal the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. On March 19, President Biden issued a,Statement of Administration Policy,with his intent to veto that bill if it were to pass the Senate and come to his desk.,Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Selectees,The $20 billion in awards announced today will be deployed through eight selected applicants across two separate and complementary programs under EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—the $14 billion National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) and the $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA). Together, the two programs will create a first-of-its-kind national network of mission-driven, community-led financial institutions that will finance climate and clean energy projects across the country, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities.,Under the $14 billion,National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF),, selected applicants will partner with the private sector, community organizations, and others to provide accessible, affordable financing for new clean technology projects nationwide. While EPA required that at least 40 percent of NCIF funds flow to low-income and disadvantaged communities, each selected applicant significantly surpassed that requirement. Therefore, almost 60 percent of NCIF funds will flow to the communities that need it most. The three NCIF selectees are:,Through the $6 billion,Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA),, selected applicants will establish hubs that provide funding and technical assistance to community lenders working to finance clean technology projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities—leading to near-term deployment of climate and clean energy projects while building the capacity of community lenders to finance projects at scale for years to come. 100 percent of CCIA funds will flow to low-income and disadvantaged communities. The five selectees of the CCIA are:,Expanding Access to Clean Energy,Today’s historic Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund announcement builds on a range of innovative tools and programs in President Biden’s Investing in America agenda that aim to empower the communities that can benefit most from new investments to take an active role in building the clean energy economy. These programs leverage a range of approaches to make it easier and more affordable for states, cities, Tribes, schools, nonprofit organizations, and businesses of all sizes to build, own, and benefit from cost-saving clean energy projects, invest in energy efficiency improvements, expand access to clean transportation, and participate fully in decisions that affect underserved communities and populations.,For example:,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",04-04-24,Biden-⁠Harris Administration Announces Historic $20 Billion in Awards to Expand Access to Clean Energy and Climate Solutions and Lower Energy Costs for Communities Across the Nation,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/04/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-20-billion-in-awards-to-expand-access-to-clean-energy-and-climate-solutions-and-lower-energy-costs-for-communities-across-the-nation/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Private Residence,Chicago, Illinois,5:27 P.M. CDT,THE PRESIDENT:  I think I should leave now.  (Laughter.),Thank you, Michael and Cari, and — for the introduction, but even more than that, for your friendship.  You know, this is an unusual business.  Some of the people you meet, that you work with, both help you in your — in your campaigns and also work with you become your closest friends, like Billy Daley.  He doesn’t want to — he wants to deny it, but he can’t.  (Laughter.),Folks, look, you know, you hosted me back in 2019, the first con- — the first event we did for the 2020 campaign.  And this is the first event in Chicago we’ve done for this campaign.  So, thank you again.,And I know your husband is not here.  He’s doing the solar eclipse, but no one has helped me more than your husband and you.  Thank you.  Thank you.,And, look, the governor is — has a hell of a job to do.  But — but I know that — that one thing about us we have in common: We both married way above our station.  (Laughter.),And, as I said, I want to thank my friend Billy for being my friend for such a long time.  Bill, you’re a hell of a guy, and there’s no way to get rid of me — (laughter) — none, none, none.,Look, it’s awful- — always special to be back in Chicago.  Election night 2008 was a — was a special moment.  We were excited to bring the convention here.  And 2024, here again in August.,Trust me when I say you governor and the entire Illinois delegation, including my buddy Dick Durbin, were determined to make it happen.  I’m not exaggerating.  (Laughter.)  Not even a little, tiny bit.,And I want to thank Michael for your serving as president of the host committee and for all you do to support us.,Look, I’m looking forward to the con- — this convention, for real.  You know, as some of you in here know me very well, I — you know, you always want to win when you run.  That’s always just the competitive nature of it.  But this is an election that I feel more obliged to win than even want to win, because the alternative is not very good.  The alternative for the country is, I think, really somewhat worrisome.,You know, we head into spring.  We’re genuinely excited about the momentum building in our campaign.  So far, 1.5 million contributors have contributed to the campaign — 1.5 million.  Five hundred fifty thousand new contributors since the last election.  97 percent of those contributors contributed under $200.,And we’re ramping up the campaign headquarters, field offices, hiring staff all across the country.  Before Trump and the Republicans have opened one single office, we’ve opened hundreds.,And while the press doesn’t write much about it, we have 18 national polls in the recent past, just since — I guess it was about four weeks — three, four weeks now — where those 19 polls, we’re ahead of Trump.  They never write that, but we’re ahead of Trump since my State of the Union Address, including the battleground states, like Michigan and Pennsylvania.,In Pennsylvania, one of the most reputable polls has us winning by 10 points.  I don’t take any of this for granted because I don’t think the polls are able to accurately predict like they used to because of the nature of how hard it is to get in contact with people.,But, look, I know not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm.  And so, just the other day, I — a defeated-looking man came up to me and said, “Mr. President, I’m being crushed by debt.  I’m completely wiped out.”  And I said to say, “Sorry, Donald, I can’t help.”  (Laughter.)  “I can’t — I can’t do much about it.”,Look, Trump is in trouble, and he knows it.  Just today, he released a video where he’s scrambling on the abortion issue — scrambling on the issue.  He’s worried voters are going to hold him accountable for the — overturning Roe v. Wade and for the cruelty and chaos that it’s created.,Well, the bad news is, for him, he bragged about,overrowing,[overturning] Roe v. Wade.  The vo- — voters are going to hold him accountable.,Voters will hold him accountable in the — for the 14 states where abortion is now illegal in all cases, even rape or incest, because of — Roe v. Wade is no longer the law of the land.,Voters are going to hold him accountable for the extreme six-week bans that exist, the women who have been turned away in emergency rooms, the women who have mo- — lost — nearly lost their lives or had their — had to flee their states to get care they needed.,For 50 years, women in America did not have to worry about a fundamental right.  It didn’t matter where they lived.  It didn’t matter whether — wh- — where they were.  It didn’t matter.  It was a fundamental right, and Trump took it away.  Now women in America today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers had.,And this is outrageous, in my view.  Mark my words, it’s going to be — move millions of voters — women and men — to the polls this year.  And I’ve said many times: Trump and the MAGA crowd don’t have a clue about the power of women in America.  But they’re not ab- — they’re about to find out.  They’re about to find out.,Look, no one — I’ll just be very blunt about it; the press is here — no one trusts Donald Trump.He’s made a political deal to get rid of Roe v. Wade.  Now he hasn’t — he’s already realized that political deal with his MAGA friends may be imposing a national ban, and if they put one on his desk, he said he’d sign it.,That’s never going to happen, if I’m elected.  But as long as I’m president, I’m going to veto any national ban on choice.  Kamala and I are determined to make Roe v. Wade the law of the land.  If you give us a Democratic Congress next time around, we’re going to do just that.,And, folks, look, chaos is nothing new to Trump.  His presidency was chaos.  Trump is trying to make the country forget how dark and unsettling things were when he was president.,But we’ll never forget.  We’ll never forget lying about COVID, telling Americans to drink bleach.  (Laughter.)  No, it’s not a — if you did- — if it didn’t happen, it’d sound bizarre.  But it was bizarre.,We’ll never forget his love letters to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and his admiration for Putin, which he still exhibits.  We’re never going to forget waiting for the tear-gassed innocent protestors outside the White House, just so he could hold a Bible upside down and — at a nearby church.,And, by the way, now he compares himself to — to Jesus Christ.  I find it fascinating.  I find it fascinating.  He also talks about how he’s like Nelson Mandela — persecuted like Nelson Man- — I mean, saying these things.  (Laughter.),If you didn’t — if you haven’t heard them come out of his mouth, you’d think I’m making it up.,Well, we’re never going to forget the insurrection on January the 6th, one of the darkest days in history.  And he did not a single thing to stop it — not a single thing — one of the worst derelictions of duty of any President of the United States in the history of the United States.,And, look, anybody want to go back to that?  I don’t think so.  Look — look how far we’ve come: 13 million new jobs; over 300 jobs — three hundred thou- — 300,000 jobs just this last month; 26 months of — two years of unemployment under 4 percent; more people have health insurance today than ever before in the history of the country.,And we looked at Big Pharma.  We looked at them for a long time.  We’ve tried like hell to get them under control.  But finally — finally, we won.  Medicare can now negotiate what price they’ll pay with Big Pharma, bringing down the cost of insulin from $400 a month to $35 a month.  And so much more to come.,We’ve made historic investments in rebuilding the country, in computer chips, combating climate change, gun violence.  But the first — I put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, as I promised I’d do.  And I could go on.,But the — but all — but this is all at stake.  Trump wants to get rid of all of it.  He’s made no bo- — all of it — all of it.,Trump wants to terminate — I love his phrase, “terminate” — the Affordable Care Act.  Why?  Because Obamacare — and when Bill was helping the President — is — is what the Affordable Care — Healthcare Act is.  It’s Obamacare on steroids.  But he can’t — because it was Barack Obama, he wants to get rid of it.,From the very beginning, he’s determined to get rid of cheaper prescription drugs.  Why?  Because the drug companies hate them.,They’re determined to get rid of the climate — he’s coming after the climate bill.  Why?  Because the companies hate it.,And he’s determined to get rid of so- — to reduce Social Security, rai- — raise the age to get rid of Medicare.,Look, the fact of the matter is the biggest threat to — Trump poses to our demo- — is to our democracy.  And, you know, all — all that is at risk in 2024: the freedoms, our democracy.,Trump only embraces the violence of — not only embraces — embraces the violence of January 6th, he’s running on it.  Do you ever see his ads?  He’s running on it.  He calls the insurrectionists who are in prison now — he calls them “patriots.”  And he says, if reelected, he wants to pardon them.,Now Trump says if he loses again, there will be another “bloodbath” — his phrase, not mine.  It’ll be a “bloodbath” if he loses again.,Well, folks, we must say with one voice as Americans — as Democrats, independents, Republicans — there’s no place for political violence in America — none, zero, never.  Period.,Let me close with this.  This election is about competing visions for America.  Trump’s vision is one that is really full of anger and hate and revenge and retribution.  He looks at America and sees a failing nation — his phrase, not mine — his phrase: “a failing nation.”  He’s dead wrong.,I have a very different view of America — and I mean this from the bottom of my heart — one of hope and optimism.  I see an America where we defend democracy, we don’t diminish it.  I see an America where we protect the freedoms — the freedom to vote, the freedom to choose — not take them away.,I see an America where the economy grows from the middle out and the bottom up, not just the top down, and where working — and where working people finally have a shot — finally have a shot, where healthcare is a right not a privilege.,I see a future where we save the planet from a climate crisis and our country from gun violence and still grow significantly.,And this — look, folks, this election is about democracy, freedom in America.  I wish the stakes weren’t this high, but they are.  That’s why I need you.  I know we can do this together.,I’ve never been more optimistic about our future.  And,I,[we] have to remember who we are.  We’re the United States of America.,I told a couple of you in the past that, before Dr. Kissinger died, 10 days before, I got a phone call: Would I talk to him?  So, I called him, and he said something fascinating to me.  And I knew him because I was a young senator when — during the Vietnam War, when he was Secretary of State and we used to argue like hell.,And he said, you know — he said, “Not since Napoleon — not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their shoulder at Russia with dread and fear and concern, until you guys came along.”  And he said, “What you’re done, you’ve strengthened NATO, you’ve expanded NATO, you’ve set into motion where the next six decades can be de- — decades of peace in Europe, not insecurity, because of what you’ve done.”,Well, what’s he doing now?  He refuses to — we had the ability to get a deal where we finally continued to support Ukraine.  He got on the phone and called the Republican senators and said, “Don’t vote for it.  Don’t be for it.”  Why?  Because he doesn’t want to offend Putin.  He has a secret plan.  I bet I know what the secret is.  That what you’re going to do is — he’s going to work out something, if he’s president, where he gets Ukraine to give up a big chunk of its land that has been invaded in order to get peace.,Look, folks, I’ve been doing this job in politics for a fair amount of time.  I know that sounds strange for a 40-year-old guy to say that.  (Laughter.)  But all kidding aside, we are, as Madeleine Albright said, the essential nation.  The rest of the world looks to us.,Who fills the vacuum if we’re not there?  I mean it sincerely.  And we’re not — we’re not sending American troops.  Who fills the vacuum, though, if we’re not there?  What happens if we’re not there?,Every international meeting I attend — and I knew — I think Bill would agree that the reason Barack asked me to be vice president was because of my background in foreign policy.  I’ve known most of these heads of state for a long time.  I know all of them now as well.,Every international meeting I attend — and Madeleine Albright was right about us being essential nation — not because of me, because I’m the President of the United States of America, every one — one of them, they’ll get to me in the corner before the meeting is adjourned and grab my arm and say, “You can’t let him win.  My democracy is at stake.”  And not about me.  They really, genuinely worry about their democracies.,What happens?  What happens in Europe?  What happens if we don’t do what we’ve been doing able to keep China where it was?  What happens if we don’t continue to maintain these allegiances?,Folks, look, there’s a great deal at stake, but I’m confident — I’m absolutely confident the American people are ready to face the challenge.  And we — because if we don’t, we’re going to have a real problem.  And I think they know it.,So, what you’ve done is you put me in a position to be able to fund a campaign.  As I said, we have significant contributions from significant group of people all across the country.  And they’re Democrat, Republicans, and independents.,And so — and, by the way, I promise you, we’re putting it to good use.  We’re opening hundreds of headquarters and so on and so forth all across the country.  And we’re just getting this rooted in everyday campaign techniques that are going out, particularly in the states that are the toss-up states.,So, I think we’re going to be in good shape, but only because of you, if it occurs.  We have to win.  We have to win.  Democracy, I think, depends on it, for real.,So, thank you very much for your confidence.  And I promise you, I’ll do everything in my power not to let you down.  (Applause.),5:41 P.M.

JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.,Q    Good afternoon.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No bunny today.  No bunny.  Just — just me and the Admiral and the team.  (Laughs.)    Okay.,So, yesterday, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the state’s dangerous abortion ban, putting desperately needed medical care further out of reach for millions of women.  What’s worse, this ruling is also expected to trigger Governor DeSantis’s even more extreme ban that would prevent women from accessing care before many even know they are pregnant.,We will continue to stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to choose.  President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to work to protect reproductive freedom and call on Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade.,Second, starting this week, the White House will push congressional Republicans to extend funding for the Affordable — the Affordable Connectivity Program.  Created as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the program is helping over 23 million Americans save between 30 bucks and 75 bucks per month on high-speed Internet costs.  But funding for the program is set to expire, and millions of Americans will lose this benefit in the coming weeks.,Six months ago, President Biden sent a request to Congress for $6 billion in supplemental funding to extend the program, but Republicans in Congress have failed to act.,If congressional Republicans continue to do nothing, tens of millions of their own constituents will see their Internet cost go up.  And some may lose access to high-speed Internet altogether.,Finally — actually, additionally — under the President’s Unity Agenda, we are prioritizing effort to counter the trafficking of illicit drugs to save lives.  We are leading initiatives to step up counternarcotics cooperation, including with Mexico and the PRC, and launch the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats, which brings together more than 150 countries against cartels and illicit finance.,Working with our Mexican — Mexican partners, we have charged leaders of the,Sinula,—,Sinula,[Sinaloa] cartel.  And yesterday, we charged 41 individuals connected to the Jala- —,Jalasco,[Jalisco] New Generation Cartel.  To date, we have sanctioned over 290 individuals and entities involved in the global illicit drug trade.,A lot more work is needed.  And that’s why the President is pushing hard for the House to pass the Senate’s border security agreement — or for — for Congress, more broadly, obviously, because it did not get thr- — did not get out of the Senate yet — for Congress to push forth the border security agreement, which would provide additional technology to stop these illicit drugs.,Now, it’s important to acknowledge when a mistake has been made and take responsibility for it.  So, I want to recognize the Daily Caller for having the integrity to retract their story about the false claims that circulated this week about the Easter Egg Roll.,Now, I’m quoting from their retraction here: “The ban of religious symbolism on eggs as part of the White House Easter Egg Art Contest has been longstanding, dating back decades, and the Biden administration did not make any modifications to this rule.”,So, we hope others learn from their good example.  So, I’ll leave that there.,And finally — finally, I want to read out the President — the President who — the President’s call.  He called Chef José Andrés to express that he’s heartbroken by his — by this news of the airstrike that killed seven aid workers and to express and share his deepest condolences.  The President conveyed he is grieving with the entire World Kitchen — World Central Kitchen family.,The President felt it was important to recognize the tremendous contribution World Central Kitchen made — has made to the people in Gaza and the people — and people around the world.  The President conveyed he will make clear to Israel that humanitarian aid workers must be protected.,Now, as you can see, Admiral John Kirby is here to discuss the President’s call with President Xi and — and events in the Middle East.,Admiral, the floor is yours.,MR. KIRBY:  Thank you, Karine.,Good afternoon, everyone.,Q    Good afternoon.,MR. KIRBY:  As you all know, President Biden spoke by phone today with President Xi — Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China.  The purpose of the call was to build on the two leaders’ meeting in Woodside, California, back in November of last year.,Over the course of about an hour and 45 minutes, the two leaders held a candid and constructive discussion on a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues, including areas of cooperation and areas of differences.  They encouraged continued progress on issues discussed at the Woodside Summit, including counternarcotics cooperation, ongoing military-to-military communications, talks to address artificial-intelligence-related risks, and continuing efforts on climate change and people-to-people exchanges.,President Biden also emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and he reaffirmed the importance of the rule of law and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.,He raised concerns over the PRC’s support for Russia’s defense industrial base and its impact on European and transatlantic security.  And he emphasized that the United States’s — he emphasized the U.S.’s enduring commitment to the complete denu- — denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.,President Biden also raised continued concerns about the PRC’s unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices, which harm American workers and families.,President Biden also emphasized that the United States will continue to take necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security, without unduly limiting trade and investment.,The President also repeated his call for China to release U.S. citizens who are wrongfully detained or under exit bans.,Now, we believe that there is no substitute for regular communication at the leader level to effectively manage this complex and often tense bilateral relationship, and both presidents agreed to pick up the phone and speak when needed.,Following the leaders’ call, we will continue to advance our interests through Cabinet-level diplomacy, including visits to China by Secretary of the Treasury Yellen and in coming days — I’m sorry, in coming days — and by Secretary Blinken in coming weeks.,Now, if I could just — as Karine noted, just turn briefly to events in the Middle East.  We were outraged to learn of an IDF strike that killed a number of civilian humanitarian workers yesterday from the World Central Kitchen, which has been relentless in working to get food to those who are hungry in Gaza and, quite frankly, around the world.,We send our deepest condolences to their families and loved ones.,We’ve seen the comments from Prime Minister Netanyahu and from the Israeli Defense Forces about their commitment to conduct an investigation.  As we understand it, a preliminary investigation has been completed today and presented to the Army Chief of Staff, and we’ll — we’ll obviously look to see what they — what they discover in this preliminary one.,But we expect a broader investigation to be conducted and to be done so in a swift and comprehensive manner.  We hope that those findings will be made public and that there is appropriate accountability held.,But — I’m sorry.  More than 200 aid workers have been killed in this conflict, making it one of the worst for aid workers in recent history.  This incident is emblematic of a larger problem and evidence of why distribution of aid in Gaza has been so challenging.,But what — beyond the strike, what is clear is that the IDF must do much more — must do — must do much more to improve deconfliction processes so that civilians and humanitarian aid workers are protected.,The U.S. will continue to press Israel to do more as well to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers.  And we’ll continue to do all we can to deliver this assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.,Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thanks.  John, do you have any worries regarding Israel and Gaza about the floating dock?  And how can aid workers be protected?,MR. KIRBY:  “Worries” — what do you mean by “worries”?,Q    Any concerns about its status, viability?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, I mean, let me break that up —,Q    (Inaudible.),MR. KIRBY:  — a couple of ways.,Q    Yeah.,MR. KIRBY:  I mean, obvi- — obviously the temporary pier — it’s known as a JLOTS — joint logistics over-the-shore — it’s on its way to the Eastern Mediterranean right now.,It’s not — hasn’t arrived yet, and it’ll take some time once it gets there to be assembled and to achieve what we call interim operating capability.  We expect that — we expect that that will happen in coming weeks.  There’s no concern in terms of our ability and the skills taken to — needed to build it and to get it up and running.,What we are working with partners in the region are two things.  One is the logistics flow, getting — getting the maritime materials to the pier, and then working the Israelis, in particular, about how that pier is protected and secured and how the aid, the material gets from the pier into Gaza and further distributed.,Those modalities are still being worked out.,Q    And do the recent events, like the strike you referenced, raise additional —,MR. KIRBY:  Oh, believe me, we’re under no — no illusion about the fact that Gaza is a war zone.  And forced protection of our troops, which will not be entering Gaza, will be first and foremost in the President’s mind as well as our military leaders to make sure that they can operate that pier — assemble it and operate it in a safe way.,But, believe me, we’re — we’re well aware Gaza is a — is a war zone.  And, frank- — fra- — that it is a war zone is, again, what makes it so challenging to get the humanitarian aid to people in need.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nancy.,Q    Thanks.  John, you said that the White House is “outraged” by the strike that killed these World Central Kitchen workers.  Has the White House already conveyed that outrage to anyone in the Israeli government?  And what was their response?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, I won’t speak for the Israelis.  We — we’ve been very clear about our feelings over — over this particular strike and our expectations of — of the Israelis.,Q    Have they provided or has the Pentagon been able to gain any understanding of what happened here yet?  I know it’s early, but it sounds, based on what José Andrés has said, that these workers were doing everything right.  Their vehicle was marked.  They were in a safe zone.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.,Q    What more could they have done?,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  It’s really — I mean, it’s devastating to — to see these images and to hear these early reports about the steps that they tried to take to protect themselves.  But the Israelis — look, they’ve already said this was on them and they’re doing this investigation.,We obviously want to — want to make sure that that investigation gets completed and is as transparent as possible and, as I said in my opening statement, that there’s accountability to be — to be held here.,Q    One quick question on — on China.  What was the President’s message to the President when it comes to Chinese misinformation campaigns or any effort by the Chinese government or people associated with the Chinese government to interfere with the 2024 election?,MR. KIRBY:  I would just say that we’ve been clear consistently, even going back to the November meeting in California, about our concerns over our own election security and — and efforts by certain actors, including some from the PRC, to — to affect that.,Q    So, there was no new message in this conversation?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have a new message to read out to you today.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Selina.,Q    Thanks, Admiral.  On the death of those World Central Kitchen aid workers, which includes one American who was killed, Netanyahu’s reaction was, quote, “It happens in war.”  What is your reaction to that comment from Netanyahu?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t think it’d be useful for me to get into a tit for tat here with the Prime Minister of Israel from the podium.  We’ve been very clear about our expectations for this investigation.  We noted that the Prime Minister said himself there will be an investigation.  So has his military said that.,We look forward to that investigation being thorough and qui- — and swiftly done and, as I said, that — that it’ll be transparent, the results of it, and that if there’s accountability that needs to be had, that it will be had.,Q    But how can you take Netanyahu at his word?  As Nancy was saying, this was a deconflicted zone.  They had marked their car.  They had even coordinated their movements with the IDF.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, and as I said in my opening statement, the — obviously, setting aside this incident, because this isn’t the first one, there are issues of deconfliction that clearly need to be fleshed out and improved.,Q    So, how can the U.S. continue to send aid to Israel without any conditions?  Yes, they have a right to defend —,MR. KIRBY:  We’re not sending aid to Israel.  We’re sending aid into Gaza.  And that’s —,Q    Well, weapons.  How can they —,Q    Military aid.,Q    How can the U.S. continue to send military aid to Is- —,MR. KIRBY:  Oh, military assistance.,Q    — Israel without any conditions?  Is there no red line that —,MR. KIRBY:  Now, we —,Q    — can be crossed here?,MR. KIRBY:  You know, we’ve had this — we’ve had this discussion, you and me, quite a bit from up here.  They’re still under a viable threat of Hamas.  We’re still going to make sure that they can defend themselves and that the 7th of October doesn’t happen again.,That doesn’t mean that it’s a free pass, that — that we look the other way when something like this happens or that we aren’t — and haven’t since the beginning of the conflict — urge the Israelis to be more precise, to be more careful, and, quite frankly, to increase the nu- — the amount of humanitarian assistance that gets in.,You know, I haven’t been asked about it yet, but I expect that I would be.  You know, there was a discussion just yesterday with our Israeli counterparts about Rafah.  Now, this one was done virtually.  We expect there will be an in-person meeting here in a week’s time or so.,But the whole reason to have that meeting was to talk about our concerns over a major ground operation in Rafah and to present viable alternatives for them to be more precise and more targeted.,So, the idea that we’re — that we’re,whirstling,[whistling] past the graveyard here and we’re not paying attention to — to the civilian casualties or the civilian suffering is just not true.,Q    Right.  But these are verbal urgings, verbal commitments.  There’s no other incentive besides —,MR. KIRBY:  I — I know —,Q    — the urges and the discussions, right?,MR. KIRBY:  — you want us — you want us to hang some sort of condition over their neck.  And what I’m telling you is that we continue to — to work with the Israelis to make sure that they are as precise as c- — as they can be and that more aid is getting in.  And — and we’re going to continue to — to take that approach.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Matt.,Q    John, I just wanted to follow up.  Do you guys have confirmation of the nationalities of the victims who were — who were killed in — in the strike —,MR. KIRBY:  I —,Q    — and that one was a U.S.-Canadian national?,MR. KIRBY:  I can confirm that one was a dual-national American citizen.  But I don’t — I couldn’t speak with authority about the nationalities of all of those.  And as I understand it, I mean, there could be additional casualties coming in terms of the count.  I just don’t know.,Q    And do you know if there has been any outreach to the family of that dual-national citizen from the White House?,MR. KIRBY:  The State Department has done some initial outreach, and I would fully expect you’ll — you’ll see outreach from us at the appropriate time.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Danny.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, Admiral.  Does — does the White House accept Prime Minister Netanyahu’s explanation that this incident was “unintentional,” as he put it?,MR. KIRBY:  I think the investigation will bear that out.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Kelly O.,Q    Sir, do you think that — given these circumstances, is there a role for some kind of a protective force for aid workers, given the threat of widespread famine and concerns about the — you’ve already discussed the JLOT[S] coming in and so forth.  Is there a — a role that could be considered to try to protect aid workers with a neutral-party security force?,MR. KIRBY:  That protective force ought to be the IDF, Kelly, as we’ve said.  And as they conduct operations in an urban, highly populated environment, they have a concomitant obligation to take care of the civilians that are living there  and the civilians, quite frankly, that are being moved about by the combat operations that are being conducted in a very confined space.  They have that obligation.,Q    Are you concerned that aid will be cut off for some period of time now?  Because José Andrés has said they were —,MR. KIRBY:  He has said — yeah.,Q    — suspending operations for a period.  The World Food Program is having difficulties.  It seems like this incident is exacerbating the crisis.,MR. KIRBY:  It certainly isn’t helping.  There is no question about that.  And we obviously respect Chef Andrés’s decision not to continue operations, at least for a time.  Certainly, we respect that.  And — and others may make that decision, as you talked about the World Food Program.,We’re not seeing a wholesale declination here of humanitarian assistance in there.  But obviously, yes, that’s a concern.  The more violent it gets for humanitarian aid workers — and as I said, this is one of the worst in recent history — the less likely it is that they’re going to be willing to take those risks, which means it’s more likely that the people of Gaza are going to just suffer all the more.,So, yes, it’s a concern.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nandita.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  Secretary Blinken, during his presser in Paris, did not condemn the airstrike even though, as you confirmed, there was a dual American-Canadian citizen who was killed.  The French Foreign Minister, who was at the same presser, did.  You said you’re outraged.  Why — why is the U.S. not condemning this strike?,MR. KIRBY:  I think by out- — by saying we’re “outraged,” I think you can fairly characterize that as condemning the strike itself.  Of course, I mean, nobody wants to see this kind of violence happen to humanitarian aid workers who, as was noted earlier, were doing all the right things.,Q    And just to follow up to what, you know, was asked earlier about the — about the floating pier.  Are you considering moving it off the coast of Gaza?  I mean, just trying to figure out how —,MR. KIRBY:  Well, by definition, it’s going to be operating off the coast.,Q    Sure.  But, like, further away.  I mean, how do you ensure that any private partners that the U.S. ends up partnering with to deliver aid is actually protected given the recent set of strikes?,MR. KIRBY:  Right.  That’s what I said we’re working on right now.  I mean, force protection for the troops and the people that are going to be operating the pier is obviously going to be a paramount concern.  But it’s only as good as the aid that gets to the pier and then gets into Gaza.,So, there’s going to have to be plans made — plans with partners — to do everything that we can to ensure that that aid is safely assembled and collected at the pier and then safely distributed into Gaza.,It’s going to be a multistep process.  We’ll be responsible for some parts of that, but not all of it.  That’s going to take some teamwork, and we’re working our way through that right now.,Q    I just have a quick clarification on something that the Secretary said, again, in Paris.  He appeared to suggest that Iran delivered missiles to Russia and that those are being used by Moscow to target the Ukrainians.  I mean, can you confirm if that was the case — not just drone missiles but ballistic missiles?  And if — if yes, since when has this transfer been underway?,MR. KIRBY:  I am not aware of specific verification that we can give to Iranian missiles being delivered to Russia for use in Ukraine.  They certainly continue to deliver drones and actually helping the Russians manufacture Iranian-designed drones.,And we do know that the Russians are and have been using now for quite some time ballistic missiles that they have gotten from North Korea.  But I’m not — I’m not personally aware of — of any — any verification that Iranian missiles have been — have been transferred and used.,Q    Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  Admiral, you said that there is going to be an investigation into the World Central Kitchen strike and you’re reserving the U.S.’s judgment until that’s completed.  But what’s a reasonable timeframe for that investigation to be concluded?  And how regularly will the U.S. be getting updates on it?,MR. KIRBY:  I think in terms of timeframe, as I said in my opening statement, we — we believe an investigation can be thoroughly conducted in a swift manner.  Now, what is swift?  I think, obviously, we’re not going to dictate a date on the calendar to the Israelis.,But it’s — it’s noteworthy that just before coming out here I was informed that they have completed a preliminary investigation and are reporting that up the chain of command.  That’s — that’s good.  That means that they’ve gotten some basic findings and some initial conclusions that they’re — that they’re willing to make.,They have noted publicly that — that they were responsible here.  So, that’s another — that’s another reason to suspect that it shouldn’t need to be a long, drawn-out, weeks-long investigation.  I think something like this could probably resolve- — be resolved in a — in a matter of days.,Q    On the strike in Damascus.  Does the U.S. expect Iran to retaliate?  And if so, how?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, I can’t predict what the Supreme Leader and what the IRGC will decide to do or not.  I don’t know — in terms of retaliation, I assume you mean against the United States.  Let me make it clear: We had nothing to do with what — the strike in Damascus.  We weren’t involved in any way whatsoever.,So, the comments by the Iranian Foreign Minister that somehow we’re to be held to account or that we’re to blame is just nonsense.  We had nothing to do with it.,We will, as we always have, take our force protection very seriously to protect our troops and our facilities in Iraq and Syria.  And as we have demonstrated in the past, as President Biden has made very, very clear through the actions he has ordered, we will — we will do what we need to do to protect those troops and facilities.,Q    And finally, if I may, just on China.  You said that the two leaders made a commitment to pick up the phone and call each other when needed.  I’m curious —,MR. KIRBY:  When is the next one?,Q    No, I’m curious why it was needed now.  Why not next week, next month?  Was there a particular catalyst that they needed to have this phone call —,MR. KIRBY:  No.  No, no —,Q    — today?,MR. KIRBY:  — not at all.  I mean, they met, again, in November.  And the teams have been working a lot since November on fentanyl precursors, on climate change, on economic practices.  So, there’s been — on artificial intelligence.  There’s been a lot of staff-level work.  And both presidents thought that now, a few months later, this was a good time to kind of check in with one another, see how that’s going, discuss the future.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Hi.  Thanks, John.  Just wanted to follow up with a question that came from the front row about the conditions of military aid, and you said that the questioner wanted you to hang some conditions over their necks — that’s the Israelis — and your tone suggested you wouldn’t do that.  Why not?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ve already answered this question a whole bunch of times.  We believe that the approach that we’re taking is working, in terms of making it clear to the Israelis what our expectations are.,I’m not going to get ahead of decisions one way or another that we might take in the future.  What I’m saying is: Right now, we are continuing to support Israel because they continue to need military assistance because they continue to face a viable threat.,Q    But on the point of conditions, the President, on February 8th, issued a memo.  And it said — and you already know this, but just for context.  It said that it was the policy of this administration to “prevent arms transfers that risk facilitating or otherwise contributing to violations of human rights or international humanitarian law.”,Is firing a missile at people delivering food and killing them not a violation of international humanitarian law?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, the Israelis have already admitted that this was a mistake that they made.  They’re doing an investigation.  They’ll get to the bottom of this.  Let’s not get ahead of that.,Your — your question presumes, at this very early hour, that it was a deliberate strike, that they knew exactly what they were hitting, that they were hitting aid workers and did it on purpose.  And there’s no evidence of that.,I would also remind you, sir, that we continue to look at incidents as they occur.  The State Department has a process in place.  And to date, as you and I are speaking, they have not found any incidents where the Israelis have violated international humanitarian law.  And lest you think we don’t take it seriously, I can assure you that we do.  We look at this in real time.,Q    They have never violated international humanitarian law ever in the past five to six months?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m telling you the State Department has looked at incidents in the past and has yet to determine that any of those incidents violate international humanitarian law.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Nadia.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  Mr. Kirby, Israel has killed a senior Hamas leader in Beirut with precision weapons in an area where thousands of civilians were there.  They killed senior Iranian officials in Damascus — in the heart of Damascus with serious — there was thousands of civilians there as well.,Does it make sense to you that a vehicle marked with “World Central Kitchen,” after coordinating with the Israelis, that they didn’t see it?  And doesn’t it — this debunk your theory and defense of Israel that it is difficult for them because Hamas embedded with the civilian population when they can go after Hamas leaders in the heart of a civilian population in Beirut and in Damascus?,MR. KIRBY:  To your second question, no.  It’s not my theory.  I have talked about —,Q    Defense —,MR. KIRBY:  Wait.  Now, just — hang on just a second now.  W- — I’ve talked about this for months now.  Fighting in an urban, highly populated, condensed environment like that is tough.  But they have taken strikes against Hamas leaders in — successfully taken strikes against Hamas leaders in Gaza.,I can’t speak to what happened in Damascus.  That — I can only tell you that the United States wasn’t involved.  So, I’m not going to talk about the details of that whatsoever.  I’m telling you that they have taken precise strikes against Hamas in Gaza.  They have also taken strikes that have been not precise.,It looks as if, very clearly, what happened yesterday is one of those examples.  They’ll investigate that.  And our expectation is — and we’ve made this clear to them — that they’ll come clean about what they’ve learned, they’ll be fully transparent, and if people need to be held accountable, that they’ll be held accountable.,Q    Admiral.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thank you.  John, there’s another case of somebody who was in this country illegally allegedly murdering a young woman — this time in Michigan.  Her name was Ruby Garcia.  Donald Trump is out there now calling this “Biden’s border bloodbath.”  What do you call it?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, first of all, while I’m not aware of this — the specifics of this case, I mean, that’s just terrible news.  And our thoughts and prayers obviously go to the family of Ms. Garcia.  I mean, that’s — that’s the kind of news no family ever wants to get, ever.,And we would certainly defer to local law enforcement and investigative bodies to do th- — do the spade work that needs to be done to figure out exactly what happened to — to Ruby and to hold the perpetrators accountable for that.  So, why don’t we let the judicial process play out here before we start making grandiose bumper-sticker comments about what this says about the border.,And, Peter, to folks that are concerned about border security, the President would be the first one to stand up here and say he agrees: The border does need some security capabilities, that we do need more Border Patrol agents.  And all that has to happen is for the Speaker to do his job, put that supplemental on the floor.  Let’s get a vote.  Let’s get those 13,000 additional Border Patrol agents down there to do their jobs.,Q    But everybody in this room knows that the bill that you guys keep talking about as a solution is dead at the moment and —,MR. KIRBY:  Says you.  It doesn’t need to be dead, does it?,Q    The bill is dead.,MR. KIRBY:  Says you.,Q    When’s the vote?,MR. KIRBY:  You — you ask Speaker Johnson that.,Q    The bill is —,MR. KIRBY:  It doesn’t need to be dead.,Q    There are — there are real problems at the border while that bill just languishes.  Right?  The — the Chief of the Border Patrol is saying —,MR. KIRBY:  Exactly.,Q    — of 140,000 gotaways, if we don’t know who is coming into our country and we don’t know what their intent is, that is a threat.  Does President Biden agree?,MR. KIRBY:  The President absolutely believes that, along that border, we do have significant national security concerns that have to be met.  But you said something really good in your question that I loved: that while this — while these concerns are going on, the bill languishes.,So, what’s needed?  It’s not — it’s not anything more from the President.  What’s needed is for Speaker Johnson to do his job and get that thing on the floor.,Q    The President —,MR. KIRBY:  Let’s get it voted on.,Q    — as — as the person —,MR. KIRBY:  They had a chance and decided not to act because certain people in the House Republican world wanted a problem rather than a solution.,Q    As the person in charge of presenting — preventing a terrorist attack in the homeland, does President Biden think that some of these border crossers could be in the United States right now plotting a terrorist attack against Americans?,MR. KIRBY:  The President is confident that throughout the interagency — DHS, the intelligence community — that we’re doing everything we can to be as vigilant as we can to ensure the safety and security of the American people here at home.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Go ahead, Akayla.,Q    John, the call with President Xi.  Did the two leaders speak about Section 301 tariffs?  And any specific —,MR. KIRBY:  It did not come up.,Q    It did not come up.  But if you could just ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

peak more about the economic nature of the conversation.  Did they speak about competition in specific industries, like semiconductors?,MR. KIRBY:  Yes, they did talk about economic competition between our two countries.  And as I said in my opening statement, the President made clear that we have significant differences of opinion and concerns over some unfair market practices that the PRC uses that puts American workers and families at a disadvantage.  He was very clear about that.,Q    And just to follow up on Nancy’s question.  Are we clear to understand that the President did not warn President Xi about election interference?  That was — it felt like that was what you were implying.,MR. KIRBY:  It — it —,Q    Or is it there was no new message?,MR. KIRBY:  It — there was no new message today delivered on that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No — no, go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  So, you said earlier that two hundred and — more than 280 aid workers died since the start of the war.  Could you tell what the timeframe is for that?,MR. KIRBY:  Since the start of the war in — in October.,Q    So, since October 7th — 7th?  Okay.,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have a tick tock for you on —,Q    Right.  But roughly around then.  So, more than 200?,MR. KIRBY:  That’s our — that’s our — that’s our estimate here —,Q    Okay.,MR. KIRBY:  — over the course of these many months.,Q    So, did the President — has the President reached out to any other head of, you know, a humanitarian organization before today —,MR. KIRBY:  I —,Q    — after an IDF attack?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ll take the question.  I don’t know.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  We’ve got to — we’ve got to wrap it up.  Go ahead, Andrew.,Q    Thank you.  John, you described — you described the — the strike as a possible mistake by Israel.  According to Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, it wasn’t one strike but three:  the first one; then an interval during which aid workers got of their vehicles, removed the wounded, tried to move to another vehicle, which was struck; and then a third strike what — as they tried to move and escape in a third vehicle, at which point all of them were dead.,How would the second and third strikes of these marked vehicles be a mistake?  And why would the U.S. not more forcefully set conditions on the use of U.S.-made weaponry when it is being used to target aid workers?,If the first one was a mistake, the second two were targeted with the intent of killing everyone in that convoy.  So, how do you respond to that?,MR. KIRBY:  All right.  Well, first of all, there’s an investigation going on.  So, why don’t we let it get done and why don’t we see what they find, in terms of the decision-making process that led to this terrible outcome?,The Prime Minster and the IDF have noted that it was their error.  If you don’t like the word “mistake,” their “error.”,They’re investigating it.  Let them do that work and let them see what they come up with, and then we’ll go from there.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay. (Inaudible.),Q    Thank you, Karine.,Q    Sorry, one — one more, John.  Two years ago, the IDF killed an Al Jazeera journalist.  They said that that was a — a mistake, that she was wearing a marked press vest.  She was shot anyway.  (Inaudible.),MR. KIRBY:  They investigated it.  And they released the findings of their investigation, which found that they were at fault.,Go on.,Q    They did.  But my — my question, sir, is: In that case, the Is- — the Israelis did not initiate any criminal proceeding; in this case, if it’s found that the marked convoy was deliberately targeted, if not with the first shot but the second two shots, would the U.S. support any criminal penalties?,MR. KIRBY:  As I said, we would expect that should there be a need for accountability, that accounta- — that accountability be properly put in place for whoever may be responsible for this.  But again, that’s going to — a lot of that is going to depend on the investigation.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Just want to (inaudible).  Go ahead.,Q    Thank you.  Two questions on China.  Admiral, this is an election year.  Does the President feel political pressure to act tough on China?,MR. KIRBY:  The President, as Commander-in-Chief, feels obligated and responsible for protecting the national security interests of the United States.  And much of his conversation with President Xi this morning — which was candid and constructive, very professional and businesslike — was arranged around those priorities that President Biden holds so seriously.,Q    Is TikTok part of the conversation part today?,MR. KIRBY:  TikTok came up today, yes.,Q    Have you talked to previous Secretary Mnuchin about his plan to buy it without the algor- — algorithm?  Or do you accept this plan?,MR. KIRBY:  Have we talked to Mr. Mnuchin about his — no, not that I’m aware of.  I mean, that — he — he should to speak to that as a private businessman.,Q    Can you share more details about the conversation on TikTok?,MR. KIRBY:  The President reiterated our concerns about the ow- — the ownership of TikTok.  He made it clear to President Xi that this was not about ban of the application, but rather our interest in divestiture so that the national security interests and the — the data security of the American people can be protected.,Q    Have you made progress?,MR. KIRBY:  Is there progress?,Q    On the deal to —,MR. KIRBY:  I — I know of no progress on — on that.  As far as I know, legislation hasn’t reached his desk, and it’s — it’s still on Capitol Hill.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Final question.,Q    Thank you.  John, I have a question on Ukraine and — and on Ramadan.,So, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is warning about a new Russian offensive coming in end of May or June.  Meanwhile, Speaker Johnson is ignoring calls to put to the floor the Senate-approved legislation and coming up with a new Ukraine aid.,Do — does the administration have a deadline, which — after which you might consider emergency — some measures to support Ukraine without the (inaudible)?,MR. KIRBY:  We’ve already executed some emergency measures.  You saw the Pentagon was able to — to cobble together $300 million to support them in an emergency aid package.,We’re going to continue to look and see what more we can do.  But, quite frankly, our hands are — are very much tied here.  We need the supplemental.  That’s what is — what — that’s what will make a difference for Ukraine.,Q    Is there a deadline after which you would try to do something more?,MR. KIRBY:  The deadline was weeks, if not months, ago, when we needed the supplemental passed.  The time is now.  It’s past now.,The Ukrainian commanders on the ground are making difficult decisions about where — what positions they’re going to hold, what weapons they’re going to use.  And in certain places of the Donbas, they are losing ground to the Russians.  So, it’s — it’s way past time.,Q    And one on Ramadan.  Why the President Biden has not included Muslim community leaders in the iftar.  And why is the event is not open press as it has been in previous years?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m — I’m going to — I’m going to — that’s a great segue for me to turn it right over.  (Laughter.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you, Admiral.,MR. KIRBY:  Yes, ma’am.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you so much.,Q    Well, Karine, can you answer this question please?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  So, just a couple of things on — on that question.  Look, you saw the President put out a statement very early on last month about — about Ramadan and, obviously, respecting — respecting the religion and respecting the event.,I will say, about tonight, that the President is going to continue his tradition of honoring the Muslim community during Ramadan.  And so, President Biden will — will host a meeting with Muslim community leaders to discuss issues of importance to the community.  So, he is going to be meeting with Muslim leaders, to your question.  He will be joined by the — Vice President Harris, senior Muslim administration officials, and senior members of his national security team.,And to continue the White House tradition of honoring Ramadan, as he did just last month, after the meeting, we will host a small breaking of the fast prayer and iftar with a number of senior Muslim administration officials.  So, that is what the President and the Vice President is going to be doing later today.,Q    But not — why not the community leaders?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I want to be really clear here.  So, community leaders expressed the preference of doing — of doing a meeting — a working group meeting, if you will.  They — they wanted to make sure that there was an opportunity to discuss the issues at hand.  They thought it would be important to do that.,And so, we adju- — we — we did that, we listened, we heard, and we adjusted the format to — to be responsive and so that we can get feedback from them.  And this is a request — this was actually a request from members of the community.  This is what they wanted.  And we understand that.,They wanted to — they want the President and the Vice President and senior administration officials, obviously, national security folks, as well, who will be joining the meeting, to hear directly from them.,So, this is going to be seen as a working — working group meeting, and we are — the President, the Vice President — we are looking forward to having that — that opportunity.,Okay.  Go ahead.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  We discussed earlier former President Trump is describing the situation on the border as a “bloodbath.”  But on Friday, we’re going to get jobs figures, and past jobs reports have shown that immigrants are helping the U.S. economy.  Is the view of this administration that the inflow of immigrants do more to strengthen the United States or hurt the United States?  Does it do more?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, Josh, I appreciate the question.  And I think it’s an important question, as we’re hearing clearly awful rhetoric from the other side.  So — but what we know and what this President believes — and you’ve heard this President say this before — is that we know immigrants strengthen our country and our economy as well.  It goes hand in hand here.,Think about the critical work eight immigrants — these eight immigrants were doing on Key Bridge when it collapsed — when it collapsed.,While Congress failed to act on President Biden’s comprehensive immigration reform — remember, he introduced that on the first day of his administration because he understood the importance of fixing — fixing immigration, a system that had been broken — that has been broken for decades.  His administration has led the largest expansion of lawful immigration pathways in decades.  And we continue — we continue to work [to] ensure employers and immigrants can effectively navigate the laws in place.,And so, reforming our immigration system only strengthens our economy.  You hear the President talking about that, about making sure that we have an economy that works for everyone, making sure that there is dignity and respect for everyone.,And so — and by doing that, it boosts our labor supply, it helps solve workforce shortages and — some businesses are facing — right? — that we see businesses are facing.,And so, we took a step forward not too long ago.  We spent two months working with the Senate, working with Republicans and Democrats, to try and figure out how do we deal with this broken system.  We saw — they — we put together what would have been, if put into law, the toughest and fairest piece of legislation that we have seen in some time.,But what we heard from the last ad- — last administration, from President Trump — and you heard me say this over and over again; you all reported this — that he told Republicans to reject that proposal because it would hurt him and help the President.,That’s not how this President sees this.  This President sees the immigration system as a — as an issue that majority of Americans care about and that we should fix.  We should get to the bottom of this.,So, we’re going to continue to urge Congress, Republicans, to come back — right? — to get — come back to the table, move forward with that proposal, get it out of the Senate, and then move it over to this Hou- — the House, get it out of the House, put it in front of the — in front of the President.  He will sign it — the toughest and fairest law that we have seen in some time.,And this is not about politics for this President.  And to — just to go back to the beginning of — of answering your question, we know immigrants strengthen our country and also strengthen our economy.,Go ahead.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Just to follow up on the TikTok question.  The President brought it up with President Xi.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  President Xi.  Yeah, he did.,Q    Has he also raised the issue with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer?  Because the bill is — hasn’t been taken up by the Senate.  I mean, that’s where it is held up.  Has he conveyed those same concerns about ownership, about, you know, divestiture, like, to — to Schumer?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we are in regular communication, this administration is, with leaders of Congress, including Senator Schumer — Leader Schumer and others.  And so, I don’t have a specific readout to — to give you about the President’s conversation on this particular issue.,As — as my colleague — as the Admiral said, TikTok did come up and was raised on the call with President Xi.  I think that’s important.  The President has always been very clear about his concerns, and he’s been very public about that.,There is a real threat po- — posed by certain technology services, and so — operating in the United States that put at risk Americans’ personal information and broader national security.  He’s been very clear about that, including the manipulation.,So, he’s been public about it.  He brought it up with President Xi.  This is an issue, certainly, that we will continue to have that discussion.  I just don’t have anything specific to read out to you with any conversations with members of Congress —,Q    Does he want —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — on the President — on the President’s schedule.,Q    Does he want the Senate Majority Leader to bring the bill to the floor?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We have said we support that bill.  We welcome that bill.  We do not see it as a ban, right?  We see it as a divestment.  We’ve been very clear about that as well.  And we welcome that bill.  So, we want it to go through the process.,We’ve been offering technical support of you — as you’ve heard us speak to before.  You’ve heard the National Security Advisor speak to this very recently, the last time he was at the podium.  You’ve heard me say that.,And so, we’re going to continue to provide technical support.  We’re going to continue to have conversations with members of Congress.  I don’t have any — don’t have anything else to share beyond that.,Okay.  Go ahead.,Q    So, during the call, did President talk to President Xi about supplying components to Russia to enhance their defense industrial base?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we’ve always been very clear, and the President did raise that we are deeply concerned, obviously, about the PRC’s support for Russia’s war against Ukraine and its efforts to help Russia reconstitute its defense industrial base.  That came up.,I’m not going to go beyond that.  But that did come up on the call.,Okay.  Go ahead, Selina.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Is there anything you can say about President Xi Jinping’s reaction to all of the concerns that Biden laid out?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would let President Xi speak for himself.  I’m not going to respond to him — for him.,Q    Any color about the tone of the conversation?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — you — there’s a readout of the call.  I’m not going to get into — get into reactions, personal reactions.  I will let President Xi speak for himself.,Q    And just lastly, the cost to attend a number of New England colleges this fall is topping more than $90,000 a year.  What’s the White House’s reaction to that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, we have been very clear about how the cost of college is — is crushing many, many families.  We’ve talked about that.  And that’s why one of the things that the President has been very focused on is giving that student debt relief to — to many Americans and families out there.,While we tried to put for- — something forward, Republicans blocked it, and the President continued to find ways to move forward in trying to find really comprehensive measures to make sure that we’re giving relief to — to Americans so that they can — you know, so that they can start a family, so that they can buy a home.,And so, we’ve done that.  You’ve seen us announce a bunch of — a bunch of actions which the President is proud of and is going to continue to find ways to give that relief.,The Department of Education has — has talked about the cost of — of college and has certainly worked with wor- — worked with students in fi- — in — in figuring out ways for them to afford going to school.  It’s important.  If someone wants to be able to go to college, they should be able to do that.  And they should be able to afford to make that decision.  Their family should be able to make that decision and not — and not go into debt.,And so, the President has been very, very clear about that.  He’s talk- — he’s talked about his own experience.  And so, you know, look, we’re going to continue to find ways to make sure that Americans get a little bit of breathing room, get a little bit of opportunity to move their — their lives forward, to reach their dreams the way that they choose.,And so, yeah, you know, we’re aware — we’re aware of how costly college can be.,Go ahead, Karen.,Q    Thanks.  The owner of the ship involved in the Key Bridge collapse has denied responsibility for the accident, and they’ve filed a federal lawsuit trying to limit the amount of damages that they would have to pay.  What is the White House’s reaction to that lawsuit?  And is there going to be an effort to force them to pay more damages?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I don’t want to get ahead.  As you know, there is an investigation currently happening.  The Department of Transportation is — is leading.  So, want to be really mindful, not get ahead of that, and not going to talk to an active lawsuit, as you just announced, from — from the ship owner.,But, look, I think it is important that we get to the bottom of this not just because — for us, but obviously the people of Baltimore, the people in Maryland need to have an answer here.  And so, we’re going to do everything that we can.  There’ll be investigation.  I want to be really mindful here.  But it is always important to make sure people are held to account.,For the President, he is going to do everything that he can, use a whole-of-government response, as you have seen from this administration, to continue to make sure that we do the recovery, to make sure that we rebuild that bridge, make sure they reopen the port.,And you’re going to see the President on Friday doing that visit — visit to Baltimore.  We’ll have more details on that.  But just want to be really, really mindful.  If there’s investigation going on, don’t want to get ahead of that.,Q    Will he have any conversations with congressional leaders ahead of his trip to Baltimore to talk about getting funding rolling, knowing he will likely hear from local and state —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it —,Q    — leaders about that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it’s a good question.  Look, we have said that we will fu- — the federal government will fully fund the — rebuilding that bridge.  That’s a commitment that the President is going to stand by.  Obviously, there are m- — there potentially could be an opportunity or will be an opportunity for — for Congress to get involved, and we’ll have those discussions.,We con- — we do — we are having those conversations with congressional members.  I can’t speak to what the President has on his calendar as far as speaking to congressional members about this particular issue ahead of Friday.,But I can assure you it is a conversation that members of his team are continuing to have and will continue to have as we move forward in making sure the people of Baltimore — you know, the community gets back on their feet as it relates to getting this bridge back, opening up the port.  It is critical.  It is important.  And we want to make sure we get that done.,Go ahead, Kelly.,Q    In the way you described the celebration with the Vice President and Muslim leaders and so forth, smaller-scale working group, isn’t that, on its face, really an acknowledgement that there is a great tension between the President and the Muslim community —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well —,Q    — and that you can’t do it publicly because you would be concerned about protests?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:   So, look, I mean, the community leaders expressed their — their preference here.  They said this is what they wanted to — to see.  They wanted to make su- — they wanted to have a working group meeting.  That is something that they asked for.  It is — and we listened.  We heard them.,As you know, senior officials have been — you know, senior White House officials have been traveling the country, having really important conversations with members of that community — the Muslim community, the Arab community, the Palestinian community — because we understand how painful this moment is for them and we want to hear directly from them.,This is a request from them.  They wanted to — they wanted to have a — again, a private working meeting.  They wanted this meeting to be held private.  So, we’re respecting that.  We’re respecting the fact that they want privacy.,It is not the first time that they’ve requested a — a situation where it is private.  And so, that — this is what we heard during our outreach, and we’re going to respect that.  And this is what we’re doing today.,It doesn’t take away — it doesn’t take away how we’re going to continue to honor the tradition of the Muslim community as we speak about Ramadan, during Ramadan.  This is something that we’re going to respect and continue to do so.,But in this particular instant, they wanted — they wanted a working group meeting.  They wanted it to be private.  And we’re going to respect that.,Go ahead, Nancy.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Going back to the “bloodbath” question.  The former President used that terminology a week or two ago, but he’s talking about it again today.  What’s the White House reaction to the use of that term “bloodbath”?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m going to be really mindful here because it is — the President — the — the — obviously, the former President is also a candidate here, so want to follow the law with the Hatch Act.,But we have to denounce — our response is we have to denounce any — any violent rhetoric that we hear, certainly from our leaders — right? — that tears our country apart.  It could tear our country apart and puts our fellow Americans in harm’s way — in danger.  So, we have to denounce that.,And look, you know, I think and we think that the American people wants to see the country coming together.  That’s what they want.  They want to — they want to make sure that we respect our democracy.  They want to make sure that we respect the rule of law.  That’s what they want.,And so, that is what the President is going to continue to fight for.  I’m — we’re going — any type of violent rhetoric, we’re going to denounce that.  It doesn’t matter who it comes from.  We’re going to denounce it.,Q    Does the White House believe that there is a “bloodbath” taking place or a wave of migrant crime?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we’ve been very clear about — I just laid out to Josh, when it comes to immigrants, how important they are to — to the fabric of this country, how important they are to the strength of this country, to our economy.,And that continues to — to be true, right?  That’s something that this President believes.  And we’ve always called out any — if there is any form of — of violence that — that’d be — could be caused by one person — right? — that we may have seen, we call that out as well.,And — and that is always important to do.  But in this instance, it is used to — in the way that this violent rhetoric is being used, it is being used to tear our country apart.  That’s how it’s being used.,And we have to — we can’t allow that.  Right?  This is not what Americans want to see.  Americans want to see us bringing the country together.,And — and so, that form of rhetoric, it is — it’s not helpful to us.  So, we’re going to continue to call that out, and we’re going to be very, very clear about that.,But this — you know, if — if a violent act is — ha- — happens, as we have seen, and someone is killed, we want to make sure that — that — you know, we’ve got to condemn that and want to make sure that the law comes into place and we let the law enforcement on the ground deal with that.,But to denounce an entire community — we can’t allow that.  We have to denounce that, any type of violent rhetoric.,Go ahead.,Q    Karine, just a quick point of clarification — Karine.,So, when Donald Trump is talking about a “bloodbath,” it is violent rhetoric.  What was it when Joe Biden said, in 2020, “We — what we can’t let happen is let this primary become a negative bloodbath”?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m going to be really mindful and careful about Donald Trump, but if you read — because he is a — he is a candidate.  We’re talking about the 2024 election.,You should read h- — what he said in its context.  So, you’ve got to read what he said in context.,Q    I understand.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wh- —,Q    “Bloodbath” is an ugly word —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ve go- —,Q    — when Trump uses it.  What is it when Biden uses it?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s not — no, no, no.  Let’s be very clear: You’ve got to actually ask me the question in context of what it was said — right? — and what the — what was said when he said that — right? — in his remarks, in his speech.  Right?,And so, that’s being disingenuous in your question.,Q    I’m reading a direct quote from Joe Biden: “What we can’t let happen is let this primary become a negative bloodbath.”,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s talking about — he was talking about a group of people — a group of people.  That’s what he’s talking about.,What the President was talking about during the primary was not to allow it to be — the words in — in the primary and that election to become negative.  Two different — two different things.,Q    Okay.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  They’re not the same.  They’re not the same.  And your question is disingenuous.,And so, look, I’m going to be really mindful here.  I’ve got to be really careful.  We have to denounce violent rhetoric, which — wherever it comes from — a former leader — we have to denounce that.  Because we saw what happened on January 6th.  We saw what happened there.,When you have a mob of 2,000 people go to the Capitol because they didn’t believe in free — the free and fair election that just happened months prior because of violent rhetoric —,Q    (Inaudible.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — you’ve got to denounce that.  That’s not what leaders should be doing.,All right, I think I have to go.,Go ahead, Erica.  I — I rarely call on you.  Go ahead, Erica.,Q    I — rarely raise my hand.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know.  You rarely raise your hand, so — (laughter).,Q    Back to college costs.  There are hundreds of thousands of families across the country waiting to see if their — their students will be able to afford college due to the botched rollout of the FAFSA.  And just this week, I mean, almost every day, the U.S. Department of Education is announcing another setback.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    It’s — it’s April — (laughs) — and, you know, I’m wondering what — what the White House is doing, what the oversight looks like, and what accountability will look like for these families, particularly the ones who rely on financial aid to go to college.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s a really good question.  And I just want to say that the administration is — is committed to ensuring that students have access to the maximum financial aid possible.,So, like with most major changes, implementing this new system has brought certain challenges.  And we’ve been very honest about that, and we’ve been very clear about that.  Yes, we have had some challenges here.,But we don’t want to forget: Over 6 million — 6 million records have been processed — and that’s important — and delivered to schools.  And the department has an all-hands-on-deck team to address issues quickly and get information out to schools and families.,Our top priority is, again, to ensure that students can acces- — access maximum financial aid possible.  We understand how important it is to get this aid.  And so, we want to make sure that we get that done.,There’s an all-hands-on-deck scenario.  And, yes, we have had some challenges.  And we — we acknowledge that, and we’re doing everything that we can to fix that.,Thanks, everybody.  I’ll see you tomorrow.,Q    Thanks, Karine.,2:39 P.M.

President Biden and his team have worked with Governor Moore, Senator Cardin, Senator Van Hollen, Congressman Mfume, Mayor Scott, and numerous state and local officials. The President’s message has been clear: This Administration will be with the people of Baltimore every step of the way. This tragedy has had a devastating impact on the victims and their families, and as the President has said, our prayers are with them. The victims were fathers, husbands, and friends in their homes, work, and communities. The Administration will continue to work alongside our state and local partners to attend to the needs of the families and to assist in the ongoing search and recovery efforts of those still missing.,Working Safely and Quickly to Clear Wreckage and Reopen the Port,Clearing the wreckage will be a complex and highly coordinated effort, as teams determine how to precisely cut the bridge’s steel trusses into movable pieces; develop plans to safely extract the cargo ship, which is weighed down by thousands of tons of wreckage; and as divers navigate murky waters with little to no visibility. The Biden Administration has taken decisive action to deploy federal resources to begin work to clear the wreckage and reopen the port as quickly and safely as possible.,Providing Necessary Resources to Rebuild the Bridge,The Port of Baltimore is essential to the regional economy and the national supply chain, and the I-695 corridor, of which the Francis Scott Key Bridge was a part, provides a vital connection for people and goods traveling along the East Coast. Over 30,000 vehicles crossed the bridge daily.,Supporting the Workers and Businesses of Baltimore and Mitigating Economic Impacts,The Port of Baltimore is one of the nation’s largest shipping hubs and the Francis Scott Key Bridge is critical to travel in the Northeast Corridor. The Biden Administration, in coordination with State of Maryland and other partners, has been working around the clock to mitigate the economic impacts of this temporary disruption, including:,Supporting industry to mitigate supply chain disruptions.,Since the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the President’s Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force has engaged extensively with state and local officials, Port of Baltimore leaders, industry, labor unions, ocean carriers, rail and trucking companies, and ports along the East Coast to minimize economic disruptions. As a result of these discussions and collective efforts, import and export disruptions have been minimized. This work has included:,Receiving commitments from businesses to support workers and Baltimore.,The Port of Baltimore is a bedrock for the Baltimore economy, generating over $70 billion in economic impact for the State of Maryland in 2023 as it handled record cargo. Around 8,000 people work at the Port of Baltimore facility, many of them union members. Thousands more work nearby and depend on the port, including employees at small businesses in Baltimore. Businesses large and small over the past week have rallied to make clear that they will stick with Baltimore and its workers through this temporary disruption. Specific commitments made this week include:,Standing strong with the people and businesses of Baltimore.,President Biden has made clear that his Administration will move heaven and earth to fully reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible, and to stick with the people of Baltimore every step of the way. An outpouring of support has come in this week to support the victims’ families, affected workers and businesses, and broader recovery efforts. And, the federal government is working with its Maryland government counterparts to make every tool available for these efforts.

Prices are still too high for housing and groceries, even as prices for key household items like milk and eggs are lower than a year ago. I have a plan to lower costs for housing—by building and renovating more than 2 million homes—and I’m calling on corporations including grocery retailers to use record profits to reduce prices.,Fighting inflation remains my top economic priority. We’re making progress: wages are rising faster than prices, incomes are higher than before the pandemic, and unemployment has remained below 4% for the longest stretch in 50 years. But we have more to do: my agenda is lowering costs for prescription drugs, health care, student debt, and hidden junk fees.

everybody and, in their absence, all of the teachers and the — those workers at this school for what you do every day for the children of America.,Representative Dwight Evans, it is wonderful to be with you, as always.  I know you from your work in Congress, and I know you from your work here in this beautiful state.  And you have been a very important advisor and friend to the President and me.  So, thank you.,And, Tonya Pendleton, I want to thank you for being the moderator of this discussion.,And then, in his absence, but he sends his best, Senator Bob Casey, I want to thank him for all he does.,So, this is intended to be a discussion about student loan debt.  But really, it is, from my perspective, a discussion about who are our public servants and what we, as a society and as a country, owe them for the gift that they possess and then give to so many people, often without the praise on a daily basis that they deserve.  But their value to the strength of our country, their value to our well-being is immeasurable.,And who are our public servants?  They are teachers.  They are nurses.  They’re firefighters.  They are police officers.  They are librarians.  They are bus drivers and social workers.  They are people who have dedicated themselves to serving the public, often serving on behalf of people that they otherwise have never met and would otherwise have no obligation to, other than the fact that they care and they understand the strength and the importance of lifting up other people and, by extension, all of us.,And our public servants, then, do some of the most noble and selfless work that anyone can do.  I think about our teachers — our teachers who have the — the calling to teach other people’s children and to do that work often without the resources they need.  Most of the teachers — public school teachers I have met over the years come out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies.  We don’t teach — we don’t pay our teachers nearly what they deserve in terms of the value that they give to society as a whole.,And I will say that also as a proud public school — former public-school student.  My first grade teacher, Mrs. Francis Wilson — God rest her soul — attended my law school graduation.  I wouldn’t be here except for the strength of our teachers and, of course, the family in which I was raised.,School nurses.  Nurse’s office — many of us had the good fortune of being — attending schools where there was a school nurse.  But sadly, we have not — we have not supported our nurses enough so that we can have enough of them in the pipeline to serve all of the schools that need a school nurse.,But our school nurses are — they are leaders.  They are known by the students.  They are known as the people who care for the students.  They often — they’re — the nurse’s office is an oasis of comfort and sanctity for so many students.,Our social workers, who help children in foster care — children who have, through no fault of their own, been in circumstances where they need the support and they need the encouragement of a social worker to help them know that they are special and important.,This is who our public servants are.  And yet many are silently struggling with student loan debt.,God knows we don’t pay them enough in the first place.  But so many of them, nonetheless, will choose to stay in these important roles because it is a calling for them, whereas they could potentially opt into a different profession with their skills that would pay them more.  But they stay where they are because they care.,And we as a society and a country should reciprocate that care by alleviating the burden that so many of them are carrying with this enormous debt that prevents them from being able to get through the month stress-free, prevents them, in many cases, from being able to — to buy a home or even start a family.,And so, the work that President Biden and I have been doing throughout the last three years has been to address one of the big issues facing not only our public servants but many people who carry student loan debt, which is what can we do to relieve some of the burden, because we do believe not only for public service, but most people should not have to carry this kind of worry.,And so far, then, we have forgiven, on average, $70,000 of student loan debt for over 850,000 public servants.  And for folks in general, we have forgiven over $144 billion for over 4 million people.,And that means, of course, for those individuals who have received this forgiveness, that’s more money in their pocket to pay for things like childcare, more money in their pocket to get through the month in terms of rent or a mortgage.,And so, today, then, building on the work that we’ve done thus far, I’m announcing a new plan to forgive more loans for 25 million more Americans, including millions of our public servants.  And that means, for example, if you’ve paid undergrad loans for 20-plus years or graduate loans for 25 or more years, your loans will be completely forgiven, regardless of your income and even if you did not graduate.,So, I’m going to repeat that.  If you’ve paid undergraduate loans for more than 20 years or graduate loans for more than 25 years, those loans will be completely forgiven, regardless of your income and even if you did not graduate.  And forgiveness will be automatic for the vast majority of the 25 million people that we believe will benefit from this approach.,And to see if you could be eligible, I would urge everyone to go to StudentAid.Gov.  That’s StudentAid.Gov.,And I’ll close with this.  The President and I continue to do and will do much more to build on this work, again, understanding that we want to create incentives for people to acquire the kinds of skills, like the professionals at this table, to do the work that they do that benefits so many others and benefits all of us as a nation.,And so, I thank the leaders who are at this table for being willing to tell your stories in a way that I think will inspire others to apply for the forgiveness and to do the work that we know can be done to honor our public servants and so many others.,And with that, I’m going to turn it over to Tonya Pendleton to moderate our conversation.,MS. PENDLETON:  Thank you so much, Madam Vice President.  And I certainly echo your — your wonderful entry remarks to talk about how important our public servants are and the dedication and sacrifice that they bring to their roles.,I am the host of “Reality Check” on WURD Radio here in Philadelphia.  And as you are announcing that there are student loan debts being canceled, we have these wonderful public servants here with us to tell their stories.,And so, I’d like to start just briefly with Congressman Evans, because I know that your district cuts a wide swath across Center City in West Philadelphia and the northwest, to talk a little bit about how this student debt has impacted your constituents.,REPRESENTATIVE EVANS:  First — first thing I’d like to say is good afternoon and thank the Vice President for coming here and talking about this initiative in this city.  This city is extremely significant.  So, you will always be welcome here.,So, I’ll make that very clear that you — for the service that you have provided, along with the President, has been extremely important.  You have shown the type of leadership that we need today.,And you do not — you nor the President do not let the Supreme Court get in the way when you think there needs to be something done right for workers and middle-class people.,So, I want to add my voice and my support, as a member of Congress, that I’m very supportive of that — this.  Because, obviously, the implications that you just talked about and what it means and the effect — it has an effect upon our economy: individuals buying houses, access to communities.  So, this is a very significant discussion.,And I think hel- — holding it here, as we have the superintendent here, at this great elementary school is a real plus.,So, this is the kind of leadership that I think is especially — and you, Madam Vice President, have demonstrated that.  So, I really just want to add that.,MS. PENDLETON:  Well, as you said — and thank you very much for your remarks, Congressman Evans.  We are here at Cramp Elementary School, and so, I think w- — we will just do a round robin and start out with Tonya Cabeza, who is the school-based teacher leader here at the William Cramp Elementary School.  And you’re going to talk to us a little bit about your personal story and how your education path and also how student loan debt relief has helped you.,Thank you.,MS. CABEZA:  Thank you for this opportunity, Madam Vice President.  And I’d like to start by telling my story about a time not too long ago — just last May.  I was doing what moms do in the kitchen with my three children: making dinner, checking emails.  And I open up an email that said, “Congratulations, your loans have been forgiven.”,To say I was stunned — a total understatement.  It was 40,000-plus dollars in student loans just gone — zero.  I wish you could have seen it.  There was dancing.  (Laughter.)  There were tears on my part.  Just — we knew that things were changing for us.  My — my life had changed, and what I was able to give to my children had changed.,I am the first in my family to go to college.  I didn’t know that that was going to be an option for me.  But I knew, to pursue the career that I’ve always wanted since I was little — there wasn’t a time that I didn’t want to be a teacher — that I needed to go to college and graduate in order to do this, you know, job that I love.,So, with — I was 22 years old — graduated from college.  I had to take out a loan for my entire amount of my undergrad.  And then to continue teaching and get that permanent certification, I had to do more schooling, in which I had to take out more loans.  So, I had my debt from my undergrad and then had to take out more loans to do my graduate studies in a reading certification program.,But, despite that, I did press on.  I did get that level 2 certification.  And I — I get to come here every day and work with these students, and this is my work home.  I love working here, and the loans gave me the opportunity to do that.,But now that they’re forgiven, my eldest daughter is now in college — also going into the education path — and I’m able to help her in a way that my parents weren’t able to assist me.  Even though they wanted to, they just weren’t in the position to do that.  And I’m able to help her in her — her college path into education as well.,MS. PENDLETON:  In terms of the debt being — in terms of the debt relief, what did it feel like?  When you — you talked about dancing in the kitchen, but what did it feel like for you to know that, at this point going forward, you would be able to live your life without this weight upon you?,MS. CABEZA:  I mean, I had been at that point paying loans for 20 years already, and I just really thought that that was something that I would be paying until I died.,And then, you know, my — with my daughter going to college, too — I mean, she’s taking out loans.  But just being able to help her and — and — you know, go to college and to give her what she needs to — to follow this path, I mean, it was — she was in her first year of college at that point.  So, it just was an amazing feeling to be able to help her.,MS. PENDLETON:  I dare say a life-changing feeling.  (Laughs.),MS. CABEZA:  Absolutely a life-changing feeling.  Again, I just thought I’d have those loans forever.,MS. PENDLETON:  Well, thank you so much.  Thank you so much for sharing that with us.,And then Beth Whelan, who is right here next to me, she is a school nurse.  She is at Richmond Elementary School, and we’d love to hear your story.,MS. WHELAN:  Yes, thank you, Madam Vice President.,Oh, can you hear me?,MS. CABEZA:  Yes.,MS. WHELAN:  All right.  So, I’m a school nurse at Richmond Elementary School in the Port Richmond section of the city.  I’ve been at Richmond since 2013 and with the district since 2007.  It’s an underserved community that I work in.  They have various needs that really change day to day.  30 percent of our student population is asthmatic, so it’s really important that I’m there every day and that I’m prepared.,I was hired under an emergency school nurse certification, so I needed to pursue further coursework in order to be able to continue to practice.  When I went to p- — pursue my master’s degree, I chose public health nursing because I thought it would be the most beneficial for the children and the families that I serve.,Unfortunately, I accrued a lot of student — student loan debt at this time, coupled with my undergrad debt that I still had, I was paying hundreds of dollars a month, barely making ends meet.  At that time, at the district, we hadn’t had a raise in a few years — cost-of-living raise.  And I was a single parent.,I knew I could make more money if I returned to hospital nursing, but I really believed in the importance of school nursing, so I stuck with it.  I took on a second job with a nursing agency.  I picked up weekend and evening shifts when I could.  And I — I honestly thought I’d be paying my loans forever.,I was very exhausted and stressed.  So, when I learned of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, I was very relieved, and I applied for it.,Recently, I lost my father.  I remember a conversation that I had with him shortly before he died.  He asked me if I was okay financially, as he would help me from time to time.  I had just gotten word that all of my $65,000 of student loan debt had been forgiven.  And I told him that.  I saw a lot of relief in his face, as I was not going to have that burden on me anymore.,Since then, I’ve moved in with my mom to help take care of her and the house.  For the first time in years, I won’t have to work this summer.  I can be home with her to support her and help my kids as well in school.,I’m so grateful to this program, which has allowed me to continue to work for the school district and have some balance in my life.,MS. PENDLETON:  You know, the thing that stands out is that — for the both of you, that you were getting education in order to further yourself in order to be more of a help to the people that you are serving, to be part of the Philadelphia public school system, and to be able to advance yourself, but also advance the young people that you work with, yet having to make the sacrifices — working as a school nurse and then taking on extra shifts — and continuing just to pay the debt.,So, the — the weight that comes off for you, that is something that’s translated to the people that you are servicing.,MS. WHELAN:  Yes, yes.  Yeah, it was just a huge relief, is all I can describe it as.  It was just — it was a burden that I thought that I would just carry with me for forever.  It seemed like I would never pay it off.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, and also the — it — it is a very difficult thing to lose a parent or anyone that you love.  But what a parent will worry most about —,MS. WHELAN:  Yes.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — is if their children will be okay so that they can go in peace.,MS. WHELAN:  Yes, and I feel like I was able —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And —,MS. WHELAN:  — to give him some of that.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And you also had that experience.,MS. WHELAN:  Yeah.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And just as a person who experiences that kind of thing, in addition to what you do as a professional, I’m sure that that was an added weight that was lifted from you, to let your father know —,MS. WHELAN:  Yes.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — that you were going to be okay.  Yeah.,MS. WHELAN:  Yes.  Yeah.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.,MS. PENDLETON:  And then to also be able to have that time and space to be able to take care of your mother, who I understand —,MS. WHELAN:  Yes.,MS. PENDLETON:  — is ill and then losing your father as well.  So, this has opened up some new possibilities for you.,MS. WHELAN:  Yes, because I would normally work in the summer just to have some extra money.  And now I’m able to —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  To take care of your mom.  Yeah.,MS. WHELAN:  — stay home with her.,MS. PENDLETON:  Yeah.  Yeah, that’s wonderful.,Kelli Gray, you are the social work services manager at the Philadelphia Department of Human Services.  And you work with people who are endangered, who are abused —,MS. GRAY:  Yes.,MS. PENDLETON:  — who are dealing with all kinds of dysfunction in their life.,MS. GRAY:  Yes.,MS. PENDLETON:  And yet, you have gone through the system — the school system, your daughters as well — everyone getting an education — in order to, once again, further your careers as public servants and work with the people that you work with.,Tell us your story.,MS. GRAY:  Thank you again, Madam President.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Vice President.,MS. GRAY:  Hello, my name is Kelli Monique Gray.  I’m a proud public service worker for the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, also known as DHS, looking out for the welfare of children and a proud AFSCME member.  That’s the union that I’m in.,My student debt story is like everybody else’s.  I knew I wanted to better li- — I knew I wanted a better life for myself and my two wonderful twin daughters, one of whom, Monique, is here with me today.  And I knew education was that path.  So, I took a risk and took out debt.  I got associate’s, a bachelor’s, a master’s, and I wanted a PhD.  But, ultimately, I had to stop taking my PhD classes because I couldn’t afford any more debt.,Unfortunately — I just said that — after I got my first degree, I navigated into public service.  First, elementary as a — first, elementary education teacher, helping children.  Now I’m helping children in the social work field directly with DHS.  I’ve also been at DHS for 13 years, and I have been a social worker for 20 years.,Giving direct care to children is beyond important to me.  As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I know that children need an advocate and someone who sees them, and I can recognize what they’re going through when they don’t have a voice.  That’s a big part of why I chose public service.  And I’m proud to say that both my daughters have followed in my footsteps also.,My education has been enabled me to publish two books.  One intends to help survivors.  When you have a path, you have a voice.  So, my path gave me a path to the future.,My other book is encouraging everyone to get out into the world and see it: “Pack Your Bags! We Are Going to Guinea, Africa: Exploring the World, One Country at a Time.”,I’m proud of both of my daughters.  The process wasn’t easy at all.  After graduating, my — and I had a parent PLUS loan.  My daughter graduated from Spelman.  She wanted to go to Spelman.  She applied to 13 schools.  She got all — accepted to all 13.  But Spelman was her last choi- — I mean, Spelman was her fir- — Spelman was her first choice but her last acceptance, so she was going to ace- — settle at Xavier.,We got the letter stating that she got accepted to Spelman.  I knew I had to ask help for a parent PLUS loan, and I knew I needed a cosigner because my loans were outrageous and my credit wasn’t good.  So, we did get that.,The loans, which is too high for me — my loans were $350,000.,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Wow.,MS. GRAY:  On February the 23th of this year, I took my work — my papers, because I ta- — take it to work to shred.  I opened up my letter.  I was going to shred it.  You know, I’m not even paying attention.  I opened it up.  It was from MOHELA.  And it said, “Congratulations.  Thank you for being in public service.  Your loans have been forgiven.”,I didn’t believe it.  I went on the FAFSA website.  It was all zeros, including my parent PLUS loan.  I called my daughter because she was so, so overwhelmed of not helping me, because she’s, you know, trying to do her own path.,And it’s been off of my credit report for two weeks.  So, I just want everybody to know there is help out there.  Whatever relief program it is, apply.  Just like me, I never thought that I would ever, ever get any of this done.,Two years ago, I tr- — I kept trying to buy a house, but my credit was so bad, I couldn’t do it.  So, my loans were transferring from one loaner to MOHELA.  So, I knew there was a time period where — you know, I wasn’t being sneaky or anything, but it wasn’t going to show up on my credit report.,You know what, it’s the time to go to buy the house.  It’s going to take at least six months, go — or 60 days, whatever; go ahead and do it.  To my surprise, I got approved for the loan to buy a house.  And then, you know, of course, my loans came back.  But on February the 23rd, it brought — it was just so much joy.,I can travel.  I couldn’t save any money.  I couldn’t afford $800 a month.,I just want to thank you guys so much for looking out for my family.  We just — we appreciate you guys, because if it wasn’t for you guys, I’d still been renting, I’ll still be trying to figure out how I’m going to do $800.  And I did forbearance, for- — deferment.   I did everything under the sun so it can just — and the interest rate was astronomical.,But thank you so much.  I don’t mean to cry, but — (laughter).,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  But —,REPRESENTATIVE EVANS:  Madam Vice President, let her tell you about the book that you —,MS. GRAY:  So, Madam Vice President, I have a small business.  I was in ShopRite — Brown’s ShopRite.  He owns maybe, like, seven ShopRites in the city of Philadelphia and some outside the city and in New Jersey.  I read — met — at that time, he wasn’t the congressman.  I seen him — I have a picture of him.  I showed him — he came up to my table, he brought my book.,And I said, “Oh, okay.”  When I seen that he was going to be here, I said, “Well, let me show him the picture.”  I said, “Look, where’s the book?”  He don’t know.  He never read the book.  (Laughter.),But we have a picture, and I just — you know, people, they go through a lot, but took the time to talk to me, took a picture with me, and buy the book.  It was just so amazing.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me just say that I — I cannot thank each of you enough for the life that you have decided to live.  And — and you have answered a calling — each one of you has answered a calling to serve in an extraordinary way.,When I think about the story that each of you have shared — and it’s important that — that people understand this, that when we’re looking at something like forgiving student loan debt for public servants, this is who we’re talking about.  We’re talking about teachers who — Tonya described her workplace as her home, because that’s the kind of person that you are and that our teachers are, that you give of yourself as though the children that you are teaching are your own children.,MS. CABEZA:  Yeah, (inaudible).,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right.  And she said they are.,Beth, you know, what you have done and to continue to — to go to school, deciding and making a conscious decision you wanted to be a public health nurse.  There are many places you could have gone, and we know we have a shortage, sadly, of nurses in our country.  And — and you could have been paid much more.  But you wanted to be a public health nurse and serve in our public schools and — and take care of our children — the children of the community with the debt you were carrying.,I mean, Kelli, the story of somebody who is caring for — you know, we talk about the least of these — the children who have been abused and neglected.  And this is what you have decided to do with your life for 20 years, carrying over $300,000 of debt.,What Kelli did not share — because I had the honor of meeting her daughter — is Kelli’s daughter graduated Spelman College as class president.,MS. GRAY:  Yes.,MS. PENDLETON:  Wow.  Congratulations.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And — but — (applause) — but was carrying this debt.  And so, it’s important in this conversation that folks understand, when President Joe Biden and I and our administration decided to do this, it really was, yes, about the individuals who are here, but I have to keep emphasizing: Everyone is benefiting because of the work that you each do, and we want you to stay in these jobs doing this work.  We need you to stay in these jobs doing this work.,And you shouldn’t have to make a decision about whether you serve or be able to pay your bills.  And that’s part of the spirit behind the work that we are doing.  It’s because we know who you are, and we applaud you.  We thank you in every way possible.,MS. PENDLETON:  And, you know, if I can add, I think the critical thing is, when we talk about student debt, we’re talking about student loan relief.  And this is what you’ve heard today.  You’ve heard the relief —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, that’s right.,MS. PENDLETON:  — in everyone’s voice talking about how they felt so challenged by these enormous — this enormous debt, and that having it relieved has enabled them to be able to continue to do the service that they —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right.,MS. PENDLETON:  — want to do and that they were called to do and that they have gotten their educations to do.  I mean, the palpable relief.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right.,MS. PENDLETON:  So, it is not just student loan cancellation.  This is about student loan relief and relieving this burden of debt for people who are dedicated public servants or people who have been paying for over 20 years or people who have interest rates that have accrued to the point that it has outmatched whatever they originally borrowed.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right.  That’s right.,MS. PENDLETON:  So, we certainly — and, you know, full disclosure: I am one of those people.  (Laughs.)  I had a six-figure student do- — student loan debt that was relieved last year.  And I — like you, I opened an email, and I was astounded because it — as you said, Kelli, it makes a difference.,When you have a high debt-to-income ratio, we know that affects your credit, that affects your ability to buy a home, buy a car, rent an apartment, all of those things.,And I think that is what I’m left with, certainly, that it’s — it’s relief.  It is debt relief.,And thank you so much, Vice President Harris, and — and for everything that you’ve done to bring this forward and make it happen, because it’s so significant.  You can’t move forward when you’re saddled with debt.,I had debt — I went to school when I was 17 years old.  And so, from 17 years old to now, many moons later.  And then I also went to school twice.  I went — I finished my bachelor’s.,So, I can’t — I can’t thank you enough.  And I’m sure that everyone here on this panel shares that exact same feeling.  So, thank you.,And thank you for being here with us today in Philadelphia.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It is —,MS.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Presidential Actions,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,During Black Maternal Health Week, we recommit to ending the maternal health crisis that is taking the lives of far too many of our Nation’s mothers.,Women in America are dying at a higher rate from pregnancy-related causes than women in any other developed nation.  Black women face even more risk and are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women.  That is in no small part because of a long history of systemic racism and bias.  Studies show that when Black women suffer from severe injuries or pregnancy complications or simply ask for assistance, they are often dismissed or ignored in the health care settings that are supposed to care for them.  People of color — including expecting mothers — also bear the brunt of environmental injustices like air and water pollution, which worsen health outcomes.  Too often, Black mothers lack access to safe and secure housing, affordable transportation, and affordable, healthy food.  This is unjust and unacceptable.,That is why my Administration has worked to address this crisis from the very beginning.  Vice President Kamala Harris came into office as a key leader on maternal health and continues to fight for improved maternal health outcomes, elevating the issue nationally and convening experts and activists to find solutions.  My Administration’s first piece of historic legislation — the American Rescue Plan — gave States the option to provide a full year of postpartum coverage to women on Medicaid, increasing it from just 60 days previously.  Now, 45 States, Washington, D.C., and the United States Virgin Islands provide a full year of this critical care.  We also made coverage under the Affordable Care Act more affordable, saving millions of families an average of $800 per year on health insurance premiums.,My Administration also released the Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, which outlines actions the Federal Government will take to combat maternal mortality and improve maternal health.  To start, we created a new “Birthing-Friendly” hospital designation that highlights hospitals and health systems that offer high-quality maternal care — ensuring that expecting mothers know where to go to get the help they need.  To find out which facilities are “Birthing-Friendly,” go to medicare.gov/care-compare/.,Mental health care is health care — it is so important that women have access to it throughout pregnancy and beyond.  My Administration launched the Maternal Mental Health Hotline so that the one in five women in America who experience maternal mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, or substance use disorder can get the support they need.  New and expecting mothers can call 1-833-TLC-MAMA — a confidential, 24-hour, toll-free number — to connect with professional counselors.  Tens of thousands of women have already taken advantage of this valuable hotline, and we know that being able to access support in times of need literally saves lives.  Additionally, we are supporting and expanding maternal mental health screening programs, including for postpartum depression.  We are partnering with community-based organizations to help pregnant women access services that treat substance use disorder and support victims of domestic violence.,My Administration is working to grow and diversify the maternal health workforce to better serve expecting mothers by helping health care providers hire and train physicians, certified midwives, doulas, and community health workers.  I also signed legislation to ensure employers make reasonable accommodations for pregnant and nursing mothers, who deserve job security and to have their workplace rights respected by expanding the use of break time and access to private spaces for millions of nursing parents.  I also remain committed to addressing the long-standing inequities that Black communities have faced and that continue to damage the health and wellness of Black mothers.  For example, we have been working to end discrimination in housing, make public transit more accessible to everyone no matter where they live, expand access to healthy and affordable food, and tackle dangerous environmental injustices that take the biggest toll on families from communities of color.,There is still so much to do to ensure safety and dignity in pregnancy and childbirth.  This week, we extend our gratitude to all the maternal health care workers, who are on the frontlines of this work.  Together, I know that we can make America the best country in the world to have a baby.,NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 11 through April 17, 2024, as Black Maternal Health Week.  I call upon all Americans to raise awareness of the state of Black maternal health in the United States by understanding the consequences of institutional racism; recognizing the scope of this problem and the need for urgent solutions; amplifying the voices and experiences of Black women, families, and communities; and committing to building a world in which Black women do not have to fear for their safety, well-being, dignity, or lives before, during, and after pregnancy.,IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.,JOSEPH R.

— about the tablet and the upside-down school day, it doesn’t connect with their reality.,And so, what we have done is — one of the things of our accomplishments is that we are now on track to establish for every family in America that they will have access to and be able to afford high-speed Internet, and it’s going to be a game changer, whether it be telemedicine, whether it be —,You know, one of the things that we’ve been talking a lot about — and I’ve been spending a lot of time with young people, particularly Gen Z, who I love.  I — I — you know, I know if you have them in your life, it’s complicated.  (Laughter.)  But — but about mental health, you know, this younger generation really will talk about mental health.,But one of the great things about telemedicine and mental health treatment is this isn’t — nobody has to see you walk into the “crazy house” to get treatment.  Right?  You don’t have to run into this person at the grocery store.  This can be somebody who lives 3,000 miles away, and technology will facilitate that kind of treatment that otherwise people did not have access to.,So, high-speed Internet: one of our biggest accomplishments that may be invisible to a lot of people, but for a lot of people, it’s going to be a game changer.,You know, my husband, Doug — he’s so very funny.  He’s like, “Honey, you know, the problem that we have in this reelect is that our list of accomplishments — like a CVS receipt.”  (Laughter.)  You know, the thing just goes on and on and on.  And we have to condense it and bring it, you know, down to maybe three or five things that people can process, but there’s so much.,But with that, I’ll just say this.  We’re going to win this election.  We are going to win this election.  We’ve got a ton of good material, in terms of accomplishments, that directly impact real people in a very significant way, in a way that they feel as well as understand.,And the stakes could not be higher.  You know, we all have been a part of these campaigns.  Every four — we’re perennials, right?  And every time, we said, “This is the most important election of our lifetime.”  This is the most important election of our lifetime.,I mean, we literally are at a point where we are making a decision about what the trajectory of our country will be for generations to come.,We were talking about — I was sharing with these guys that I recently saw, at the state dinner, the Prime Minister of — of Japan, Kishida.  And now, as Vice President, I have met with, my team tells me, over 150 world leaders — presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings.,My last three international trips were Munich Security Conference, Dubai for COP28, and the UK.  Rishi Sunak invited me to come, and I presented on the future of the safety of AI.,In any event, having now met many of these world leaders multiple times to the point that we are on a first-name basis, these last three trips, to a one, they came up to me, “Kamala, I hope you guys are going to be okay.”  And when they present that point, it is purely out of self-interest.,You know, sometimes I think about and — and hope that we, as the American people, fully understand the significance of our country to the world.  You know, we do, in terms of a sense of patriotism about the flag and about — you know, there’s a certain righteous bravado that we have about who we are.  But I really do hope we fully understand how significant we are to the world — flawed though we may be, imperfect though we certainly are.,But the outcome of this election will have implications that are, without any question, global and — and profound.  And we are going to win.  And everything is at stake.,And one of the things that I think we all know and you all know, which is why you keep just doing what you are doing to be so supportive and actively supportive and engaged is — you know, when we talk about fighting for our democracy — and when I am traveling, which I’m traveling practically every day and will be through November — 203 days to go, if anyone wants to know — (laughter) — I talk about our democracy, and usually, the language I use is more about freedoms.,But on the subject of our democracy, you know, there’s a duality to the nature of democracy, I think.  On the one hand, incredible strength when a democracy is intact — what it does to uplift and defend and protect the rights of its people — right? — the freedoms, the liberty of its people, what — incredible strength.  And it is very fragile.  It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it.,And so, fight we must.  And fight we do.  And when we fight, we win.  And that’s it.  (Applause.),END                 6:04 P.M.

American steel fueled the country’s industrialization and helped build the middle class. American-made steel remains critical for our economic and national security. American companies must lead the future of more sustainable steel. This green steel will fortify the infrastructure that supports our communities, form the ocean vessels that transport American goods, power the electric vehicles of our clean-energy future, and support thousands of hardworking American families.,President Biden is making historic investments in American steel and manufacturing that are a sharp contrast with the previous Administration. While the previous Administration failed to deliver an infrastructure bill, President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act are spurring hundreds of billions of dollars in private-sector manufacturing and clean energy investments. Under President Biden, investments in construction of new factories have more than doubled—after falling under the previous Administration even before the pandemic—while nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created and construction employment is at a record high. Our trade deficit with China is the lowest it’s been in over a decade—lower than any year under the previous Administration. President Biden’s strategic trade and investment agenda protects workers, consumers, and businesses from unfair competition.,At the same time, American workers in the steel and aluminum industries face a significant challenge from Chinese exports of steel and aluminum which are among the most emissions-intensive products in the world. China’s overcapacity and non-market investments in the steel and aluminum industries mean high-quality U.S. products have to compete with artificially low-priced alternatives produced with higher carbon emissions.,Steel is a critical input for our domestic shipbuilding industry—from the commercial shipping vessels that carry American products, to the U.S. naval vessels that keep global seas safe. Commercial shipyards provide industrial capacity for maintaining the U.S. Navy’s dominance and support thousands of suppliers and jobs.,The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes growing concerns that unfair Chinese trade practices, including flooding the market with below-market-cost steel, are distorting the global shipbuilding market and eroding competition. These concerns were outlined in a,petition,to the U.S. Trade Representative from five labor unions requesting an investigation into Chinese acts, policies, and practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors.,In response to China’s unfair practices, today the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new, historic actions to support American steel manufacturing and shipbuilding.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",17-04-24,FACT SHEET: Biden-⁠Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Protect U.S. Steel and Shipbuilding Industry from China’s Unfair Practices,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/17/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-protect-u-s-steel-and-shipbuilding-industry-from-chinas-unfair-practices/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As directed by President Biden’s,Executive Order,(EO) on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors, this MOA will help military spouses who are Federal employees maintain their careers and keep their families together when their servicemembers are stationed overseas. Later today, First Lady Jill Biden will be joined by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma to sign the MOA during a ceremony at the White House.,With this Agreement:,The President and First Lady, as a military family, recognize the commitment and resilience of military families as essential to the recruitment, retention, and readiness of our Armed Forces. Since Day One of the Biden Administration, Dr. Biden, through her,Joining Forces,initiative, has worked to eliminate barriers to employment and increase economic opportunity for military families. Meeting the economic, social, and emotional needs of our military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors is a national security imperative.,Although military spouses are talented, diverse, and resilient, they find themselves facing a 21 percent unemployment rate, a rate that has not significantly changed over the past decade. With more than 16,000 military, veteran, and surviving spouses working for Federal departments and agencies, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking comprehensive steps to enable the Federal government to be the model employer for military spouses. Since President Biden signed the EO last June, the First Lady’s,Joining Forces,initiative, together with the National Security Council staff and federal departments and agencies, have made significant progress implementing the nearly twenty new actions aimed at enhancing career stability, expanding employment resources, and improving transition assistance support for military-connected spouses. Key actions to-date include:,These actions represent the Biden-Harris Administration’s holistic commitment to ensuring that the Federal government is a leader among employers, modeling approaches to recruit, hire, and retain military spouse talent—but our work is not done. The First Lady’s,Joining Forces,initiative, in partnership with the National Security Council, will continue to lead federal departments and agencies in implementing the Executive Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors. President Biden and Dr. Biden recognize that the commitment and resilience of military spouses and their families are essential to the recruitment, retention, and readiness of our Armed Forces.

KIKUKAWA:  Good afternoon, everyone.  And thank you for joining our call previewing President Biden’s remarks tomorrow at the United Steelworkers headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.,This ca- — call will feature on-the-record remarks from National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard and background questions and answers with senior administration officials.,For your awareness and not for reporting, those administration officials are [senior administration official], [senior administration official], and [senior administration official].,The content of this call and accompanying materials are embargoed until tomorrow at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time.  If you did not receive the materials, please email me.,With that, I’ll turn it over to Lael to kick us off.,MS. BRAINARD:  Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon.,As you know, President Biden grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  President Biden understands that American steel built our nation and steel mills helped to build the American middle class with good-paying union jobs in communities in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.,The President is committed to ensuring that American infrastructure and industies — industries of the future, like clean energy and electric vehicles, will be made here in America using American steel made by American workers.  The President understands we must invest in American manufacturing, but we also have to protect those investments and those workers from unfair exports associated with China’s industrial overcapacity.,Our Investing in America Agenda is working.  Spending on manufacturing facility construction has more than doubled since President Biden took office.  Manufacturing employment is up almost 800,000 on his watch, higher than at any point under the previous administration.,While the previous administration failed to secure an infrastructure law, President Biden delivered more than 50,000 infrastructure projects so far: roads, bridges, rail, and ports.  And he committed that those projects would be made with American steel by — made by American steelworkers.,However, China’s policy-driven overcapacity poses a serious risk to the future of the American steel and aluminum industry.  China cannot export its way to recovery.  China is simply too big to play by its own rules.,In manufacturing sectors like steel, China is already producing more than China or the world can easily absorb.  China’s subsidies and other forms of support lead to exports flooding global markets at artificially low prices, undercutting American steel that is cleaner.,Tomorrow, the President will travel to Pittsburgh, to the United Steelworkers headquarters, to talk about actions that he will take to help protect American steel and American steelworkers.,The President’s approach is strategic, balanced, and targeted, and it has been developed in close partnership with industry stakeholders and unions who have directly lived through the impacts of China’s unfair trade practices for years.,It is also an approach where we are working with our partners and allies who also are feeling the effects of China’s overcapacity and artificially low-priced exports.,President Biden has made it clear that his vision for the future is one that doesn’t leave American workers and communities behind.  And today he continues to deliver on that promise.,And with that, I’m going to turn it over to my colleagues to talk in greater detail about the actions he will discuss.,MR. KIKUKAWA:  Thanks so much, Lael.  We’ll now take some questions.  If you have a question, please raise your hand using the “raise hand” function, and we will call on you.,The first hand I see is from Trevor Hunnicutt.  You are now able to unmute.,Q    Thanks so much for taking the question.  Could you talk a little bit about why these tariffs are necessary given the Section 232 tariffs that already exist and — and triple-digit tariffs on, you know, product-specific categories?,And then also curious if you could give an update on — on what’s happening with the U.S. Steel deal and whether the President is going to use his authorities under CFIUS or DOJ to — to block that deal now that he’s come out in opposition to it.  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Thanks for that question.  I think I can take the first part.,I think you rightly note that we’ve had 232 tariffs already in place, but I think as Director Brainard noted, President Biden has passed landmark legislations that together are driving greater investments in the manufacturing industry, and we are seeing tremendous job growth as well as investments across the board.,So, you know, we also know, at the same time as our economy is experiencing this relative strength, China’s economy is increasingly dependent upon export-led growth to essentially support their growth.  So, there is growing concern against, you know, a new export surge that may be impacting global markets.   Secretary Yellen has also spoken about this.  So, it’s critical that we get ahead of this surge to protect our workers.,I think you already know that China alone accounts for almost 50 percent of global steel production.  China is producing more steel than it can utilize domestically.  And as they think about expanding their export-led growth, of course, steel is an important channel through which it is likely to take place.  And if you look at prices, China’s export steel prices are 40 percent lower than U.S. steel prices.  And, therefore, it’s important that, you know, these new tariffs, if acted, provide a more level playing field against China’s unfair trade practices in steel and aluminum.,And I think as to your second question, which was about U.S. Steel, I think nothing new to add.  I think the President has already spoken and said that, you know, it’s important that U.S. Steel remains a domestically owned and operated company.  And, you know, I think the President will make that clear again. He has told the steelworkers he will have,his,[their] backs, and he means it.,MR. KIKUKAWA:  Great.  We’ll now turn it over to Josh Wingrove.,Q    Hi there.  Thank you.  Can you talk a little bit about the Mexico provisions here?  Did you consider actual tariffs on Mexico or on Chinese steel from Mexico?  Is this more of a warning?  Just wo- — wondering if you can walk us through that decision process.  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can take that question.  Look, we’ve got a senior team in Mexico today, and I want to emphasize our desire to cooperate and partner with Mexico on addressing imports coming into the North American market as a way of circumventing tariffs.,So, I’m not going to get ahead of the diplomatic conversations that have happened today and that will be happening in the days and weeks to come.  But I think we’re hoping to come to a mutually acceptable solution with Mexico because this is a problem that affects both of our economies.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  But I just want to just also jump in here and just say that the — the President’s calling on USTR to consider tripling the 301 tariffs specifically for Chinese imports on steel and aluminum.,MR. KIKUKAWA:  Great.  We’ll now turn it over to Doug Palmer.,Q    Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  So, just on the recommendation that USTR consider urging — consider tripling the tariffs, I mean, how does that — how does that work?  Is that a foregone conclusion that the 301 tariffs would go to 25 percent?,And in terms of the shipbuilding probe, one of the things that the steelworkers have asked for is a port fee.  They talked about, like, a hypothetical million-dollar port fee on a 20,000 TEU ship that visits the United States.  Would you expect the 301 investigation to — to lead to a finding like that?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi.  This is [senior administration official].  Happy to jump in on these questions.  And, colleagues, please feel free to supplement.,With respect to the first part of your question, so the President is calling on the Trade Representative to consider raising and up to tripling the steel and aluminum tariffs under the four-year review.,The first step would be conclusion of the four-year review.  And, as you know, that statutory review is ongoing.  We hope to see results on that review soon.,And based on the findings of that review, then further responsive action and enhancing the effectiveness of the tariffs could be taken into account, consistent with the President’s call.,With respect to your question on the ships investigation, so the Trade Representative will be initiating the investigation on ships tomorrow.  That will launch an investigation into China’s acts, policies, or practices and their burden of restriction on U.S. commerce.,So, it’s a little premature to talk about potential responsive actions now.  It’s only if there are affirmative findings, affirmative determinations that the acts, policies, or practices exist and burden or restrict U.S. commerce that the Trade Representative would then turn to consider responsive action.  Thanks.,MR. KIKUKAWA:  Thanks, Doug.  We’ll now turn it over to Andy Duehren.,Q    Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  I just wanted to ask on these concerns about Chinese overcapacity and production — if that is limited to steel?  I mean, obviously, you’re seeing that in a few different sectors in China or people are seeing that in a few different sectors in China, but obviously you’re only singling out steel.  And so, I’m curious if the administration’s concerns are limited to that sector or if they go beyond that.  Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks for that question.  I think, as you know, Secretary Yellen, returning from her trip from China, has also outlined serious overcapacity concerns in, for example, solar.  This is not a one-sector export surge or policy-driven industrial overcapacity issue; it’s a multisectoral challenge, of course.  But today’s actions that the President is proposing are focused on steel and aluminum.,MR. KIKUKAWA:  Great.  Now we’ll turn it over to Demetri.,Q    Thank you.  I’ve got two questions.  The first is on the tariffs.  How much leeway does USTR have to not accept the recommendation from the President?,And then on shipbuilding.  Given that the U.S. is really, frankly, just to — kind of a bit player globally now — when you look at all the ships being built in China, South Korea, and Japan — is this investigation intended to try and bring shipbuilding back to the U.S. or just come to an outcome where, as someone said earlier, you impose port fees to try and get some money out of the Chinese for what they’re doing?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi.  This is [senior administration official] again.,Well, with respect to the first question, the tariffs, I can just say: So, the President is calling on the Trade Representative to consider tripling tariffs consistent with the findings and the outcome of the statutory review, which is akin to an investigation.  And so, the Trade Representative would consider that as part of the — the next step after making findings, which is, you know, review of the effectiveness and looking to enhance the effectiveness of the tariffs that are in place under the — the Section 301 — existing Section 301 action.,With respect to the new Section 301 investigation, we think that the labor unions — five national labor unions — have raised very serious concerns with respect to China’s pursuit of dominance in the maritime logistics and shipbuilding sector.  So, the petition is extensive.  It raises a number of very significant concerns and presents a lot of evidence in relation to China’s nonmarket policies and practices through which it pursues its dominance with significant impacts on U.S. workers and on the U.S. industry.,So, we take those allegations very seriously and intend to conduct a thorough investigation into them.  Thanks.,Q    Can I just quickly follow up and ask: If — if nothing is going to be decided until after the 301 review, why is the President coming out now with a recommendation?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it’s appropriate as part of the President’s consideration with respect to actions on steel and aluminum to consider, you know, the application of Section 301 tariffs to this sector.  This is a sector that was targeted by China with respect to some of its force technology transfer policies and practices.,And as part of re- — our review, we consider the tariffs’ impact on the U.S. economy and how they can be made more effective in seeking to address China’s policies and practices.  And so, that’s why there is a focus on the use of Section 301 tariffs for this sector at this time.,Q    Thank you.,MR. KIKUKAWA:  Thank you.  We will now turn it over to Gabe Gutierrez.,Q    Hi.  Thanks so much for doing this.  I guess, what would you say to critics who say these tariffs will raise consumer prices, heat up inflation, or those, you know, who say it’s only — it’s only happening in an election year?  And that’s one question.,Then, secondly, is this a continuation of the trade war started by the prior administration?  How would you respond to that?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, thank you for that — thank you for that question.  If taken, these actions will not increase inflation, but they will protect American jobs and steel industry.,Let me just lay out why we see no impact on inflation at all.  First is inflation has come down more than 60 percent.  Right now, residual inflation is not coming from goods.  These actions will not change that.,Second, as you know, the President’s approach has been to invest in key sectors and expand the supply side of our economy, which has contributed to lowering inflation.  And as we are seeing manufacturing rebound, it’s important to protect those gains.,Third, our trade actions are actually strategic and balanced.  President Biden will not impose ineffective, across-the-board tariffs that would increase costs and harm hundreds of thousands of jobs.  In fact, the imports of steel from China account for about 0.6 percent of total U.S. steel demand.  So, it’s quite small, and we see no inflationary passthrough.,But it is important for us to get ahead of China’s new export surge and their continued pressure on prices that I made — that makes it hard for American steel companies to compete.  Because, if left unaddressed, it can be quite costly to workers, as we have learned from previous cycles of overcapacity and surges.,And that’s why we’re proposing these actions.  It has nothing to do with elections.  I think it has to do with the fact that we’re actually acting from a place of self-confidence and strength because our economy is growing and manufacturing is rebounding thanks to all the investments the President has made.  And it’s important to safeguard and shield those investments from unfair competition from abroad.,Q    Thank you.,MR. KIKUKAWA:  All right.  With that, we, I think, have run out of time.  If you have any other questions, please feel free to email them to me.,Again, this call is embargoed until 5:00 a.m. tomorrow.  The remarks from NEC Director Lael Brainard were on the record, and the Q&A was on background as “senior administration officials.”,Thank you.,5:24 P.M.

We call on the Senate to quickly send the bill to the President’s desk.,As the Senate considers this legislation, we urge the Senate to reject mischaracterizations of an amendment to the definition of “electronic communications service provider” that was adopted by a bipartisan majority in the House. This amendment is a technical fix designed to account for changing technological realities – the definition of “electronic service providers” adopted when Section 702 was first enacted in 2008 does not account for the technologies of 2024. This provision is also directly responsive to encouragement from a federal appellate court to update the definition of the private-sector companies with which the U.S. Government can work, under supervision of federal judges and with extensive oversight by four congressional committees, to obtain the communications of non-Americans abroad.,Furthermore, it is important to remember the limits on Section 702 collection.  Section 702 authorizes the targeting of foreigners outside the United States.  Americans, as well as foreigners in the United States, cannot be targets of such collection.  Adding yet additional protections, the amendment explicitly carves out a wide range of entities such as a “dwelling,” “community facility,” “public accommodation facility,” “food service establishment,” and more, from the revised definition of electronic communication service provider.,To be clear: nothing in this amendment changes the fundamentals of Section 702, which can be used to target for collection,only,the communications of non-Americans located outside the United States.  That will remain unchanged—period.  The Senate should pass immediately the Section 702 reauthorization and reform bill sent over by the House, before the current law lapses on April 19.,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",17-04-24,Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Upcoming Vote on Reauthorization and Reform of FISA Section 702,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/17/statement-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-the-upcoming-vote-on-reauthorization-and-reform-of-fisa-section-702/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is why supportive services are critical to building the workforce necessary to carry out President Biden’s Investing in America (IIA) agenda.

But well before the law was passed, I was working to address our supply chain vulnerabilities. This included my trip to the Republic of Korea (ROK), where I visited Samsung’s Pyeongtaek campus to see one of the largest semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world.,Now, nearly two years later, I’m pleased to announce a preliminary agreement between Samsung and the Department of Commerce to bring Samsung’s advanced semiconductor manufacturing and research and development to Texas. This announcement, will unleash over $40 billion in investment from Samsung, and cement central Texas’s role as a state-of-the-art semiconductor ecosystem, creating at least 21,500 jobs and leveraging up to $40 million in CHIPS funding to train and develop the local workforce. These facilities will support the production of some of the most powerful chips in the world, which are essential to advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and will bolster U.S. national security.,Today’s announcement of Samsung’s investment in the United States is another example of how my Investing in America agenda and the U.S.-ROK Alliance is creating opportunity in every corner of the country.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",15-04-24,Statement from President Joe Biden on CHIPS and Science Act Preliminary Agreement with Samsung,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/15/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-chips-and-science-act-preliminary-agreement-with-samsung/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Via Teleconference,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us today for an NSC backgrounder call on the situation in Venezuela and U.S. actions that we’ll be taking.,At this time, participants, please note that we have — just for your awareness, not for reporting — on the line, we have [senior administration official], [senior administration official], and [senior administration official].,Again, that is just for your awareness, not for reporting.  The contents of the call will be attributable to “senior administration officials,” and it will be embargoed until 3:30 p.m.,With that, I will — I would like to turn it over to [senior administration official].,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Thank you very much, and it’s a pleasure to be here with everyone this morning.  Thank you to everyone for calling in and for your interest.  Venezuela is a very important issue for this administration, and it’s a critical time, so I’m really pleased to be here with my colleagues from the other agencies.,The purpose of this call is to share with you that later today, Treasury will announce that General License 44 will not be renewed, and we will instead issue General License 44A, authorizing a 45-day wind-down period for transactions related to oil and gas sector operations in Venezuela.  I will let my colleague speak to some of the technical aspects of this decision and some of the current concerns that we have about the current situation in Venezuela.,But I did want to provide a few words at the top to explain why we made this decision and its implications.  General License 44 — or what we refer to as “GL 44” — was issued in October of last year to support commitments that were made in the Barbados Agreement, an agreement that was signed by representatives of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and members of the political opposition.  This Barbados agreement was signed on October 17th, 2023.,Since the GL 44 was issued last October, we have been consistent in our public messaging and our private messaging that maintaining this sanctions relief in Venezuela’s oil and gas sector depends on Maduro’s commitment to uphold the Barbados Agreement.  And over the past six months, the U.S. administration has been closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela, and we’ve remained in very close touch with a range of stakeholders to assess the Venezuelan authorities’ progress on implementing the Barbados Agreement, which is intended to allow for an inclusive and competitive election in 2024.,Over the past several months and weeks, we have completed a very careful review, and we have determined that although the Venezuelan authorities have met some key commitments, they’ve also fallen short in several areas.  The areas in which they have fallen short include the disqualification of candidates and parties on technicalities and what we see as a continued pattern of harassment and repression against opposition figures and civil society.,We were particularly concerned by the fact that the Venezuelan authorities also blocked the leading opposition candidate María Corina Machado from running and also did not allow her designated alternative candidate, Dr. Corina Yoris, to register as a candidate for the presidency.,As a result of those actions, while Maduro and his representatives have upheld certain aspects of the Barbados Agreement with respect to beginning to update the electoral registry, of starting a process to allow international election observation, and establishing an electoral timeline, Maduro and his representatives have not followed through with one of the most critical commitments, which was — (a fire alarm sounds) — (inaudible) the right of all candidates to run.,And, apologies, we have an alarm going off here.,In order to ensure that the expiration of GL 44 does not provoke uncertainty in the global energy sector, the administration —,[Moderator], I’m just going to hold here until this alarm ceases.  You can go to the other speakers, and I’ll come back on the line.  Thanks.,MODERATOR:  Sounds great.  Apologies for the interruption here, guys.  We’ll go on to [senior administration official].,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks very much.  And as [senior administration official] shared, we issued GL 44 to support commitments made in the Barbados Agreement.  Unfortunately, Maduro and his representatives did not fully comply with the spirit or the letter of the agreement.,In public statements, we outlined many of these undemocratic actions.  Maduro and his representatives maintained the disqualification of opposition primary winner María Corina Machado.  When María Corina Machado expressed her willingness to identify a consensus substitute with other opposition members, Maduro representatives prevented the democratic opposition from registering Dr. Corina Yoris.,Maduro representatives unjustly detained multiple opposition political members in civil society, and we witnessed a disturbing campaign of harassment and an intimidation of opposition actors solely for exercising their political rights to assembly and campaign.,While our focus today is on GL 44, I want to stress the enormous courage, resiliency, and pragmatism of the opposition under these difficult circumstances.,We are in regular contact with opposition representatives, and I want to highlight that it’s quite clear that they and the vast majority of Venezuelans still want and are making every effort to achieve a competitive election with a serious opposition candidate on the 2024 ballot.,Our action on GL 44 should not be viewed as a final decision that we no longer believe Venezuela can hold competitive and inclusive elections.  We will continue to engage with all stakeholders — including Maduro representatives, the democratic opposition, civil society, and the international community — to support the Venezuelan people’s efforts to ensure a better future for Venezuela.,The Barbados Agreement still represents the best available path toward a more democratic, secure, and prosperous Venezuela if fully implemented.,MODERATOR:  Thank you very much, [senior administration official].,We will — [senior administration official], are you still on the line?  Okay.  Sounds like we’re having some technical difficulties with [senior administration official].,We will go now to [senior administration official].,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Thanks so much.,Hi, everybody.  This is [senior administration official].  And while my colleagues have discussed the policy today, I wanted to take just a moment to go over some of the technical aspects of today’s action.,General License 44A issued today will replace General License 44, which means that any activity that was previously allowed under General License 44 with respect to the oil and gas sector of Venezuela will need to be wound down by May 31st.  New activity that was — any new activity that was previously covered by General License 44 will no longer be allowed.,So, we routinely allow for these types of wind-down windows to allow people to wrap up their business in an orderly manner and not cause unwanted spillover effects.,As you may know, our general licenses are broad, public, and self-executing authorizations, which means that as long as an activity conforms with what’s laid out in the text of that public license, companies don’t need to ask OFAC permission to engage in any of the covered activities.,In all of our section’s programs, OFAC also has the authority to issue what we call specific licenses.  Now, these are a little bit different.  They are non-public authorizations that are issued on a case-by-case basis based on the facts of the application, and they deal with individual circumstances.,With the wind-down today of the public general license, individual companies may now apply for specific licenses related to activities in Venezuela’s oil and gas sector, which will then be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, similar to how we handle licenses in any other OFAC program.,So, the process of evaluating a specific license includes — is not public, but it does include taking into consideration the national security interests and foreign policy interests of the United States through close consultation with and receipt of foreign policy guidance from our State Department.,Today’s action will not affect other existing authorizations related to Venezuela’s oil and gas sector, such as Venezuela General License 8M or General License 41.,And back over to you.,MODERATOR:  Thank you very much, [senior administration official].,We’ll try it again.  [Senior administration official], are you back on our line?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes, thank you.  I’m back on the line.  It wasn’t a technical difficulty exactly, but I had — did have to pause for a moment.  But I think that my colleagues covered the rest of the issues expertly.  So, I’m happy to go to Q&A.  Thank you.,MODERATOR:  Great.  Thank you.  [Operator], would you please go over instructions on how to ask questions?,OPERATOR:  Sure.,MODERATOR:  And we can open up for Qs and As.  Thank you.,OPERATOR:  Okay.  And we do have several questions here.,All right.  We’ll go ahead and take the first.,Q    Hello?,OPERATOR:  Yes, please go ahead.,Q    Yeah, this is Josh Goodman from the Associated Press.  I wanted to see, in addition to the discussion of the sanctions, whether you could talk a little bit about some of the actors in the political process unfolding now in Venezuela around the election.,Has the U.S. had any direct contact with former gov- — with Governor Manuel Rosales?  He was a presidential candidate who once ran against Hugo Chávez.  He did not compete in the opposition primary process; however, you know, he is registered to compete.,Do you consider him a real alternative to Maduro or, as some in the opposition suggest, more of a stooge, someone who serves the interests of the government?  Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, thanks for that, Josh.  Through our Venezuela Affairs Unit as well as folks here in Washington, we have contact with a broad, broad range of political actors inside Venezuela.  And I don’t want to get into the specific nature of those discussions, but I do want to stress that our goal is to support the democratic opposition in Venezuela broadly.,And to that end, we cast a — a wide net in our conversations.  And I encourage the democratic opposition, through the unitary platform and — and other venues, to come together and reach shared positions on their way forward.  And I’ll just leave it at that.,OPERATOR:  Okay.  We’ll take our next question.,Just a reminder, please remember to state your name and outlet before your question.  Thank you.,Q    Hi.  Thanks for doing this.  This is Jennifer Hansler with CNN.  I was wondering if there is any way you can quantify how many businesses or how much — what sort of transactions were made in the time that this general license was in effect and what impact you expect this to have financially on Venezuela’s oil and gas sectors?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi, this is [senior administration official].  We don’t have the figures on what exactly — what level of business was — was conducted under the auspices of the general license.  There’s not a reporting requirement, so we don’t have those exact figures.  Over.,OPERATOR:  And we’ll move to our next caller.,Q    Hi, good morning.  Do you hear me?,OPERATOR:  Yes, please go ahead.,Q    Okay.  This is Juan Hernando from TV Colombia.  Just to be clear, so this period of 45 days is only to wind down operations of enterprises that already have commitments or business with (inaudible)?  It doesn’t allow new enterprises to make business during that period of 45 days?,And the other question is: How coordinated was this decision with the Colombian government and Gustavo Petro, taking into account that he has been engaging directly with Nicolás Maduro?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is [senior administration official] again.  I’ll take the first part of that.  Under — under a wind-down general license, it is to wind down and to have an orderly completion of transactions that were in progress under the general license — that was General License 44 — that was issued in October.,If it’s about activity that was outside the scope or otherwise authorized that wasn’t under the general license, it’s not going to be affected by this wind-down.  So, if folks took on new activity that needed General License 44 to be compliant with our sanctions, it’s that activity that we would expect to be wound down under our — under our wind-down authorization that we’re issuing today.,Over.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This is [senior administration official].  I’ll start on the first part of the — of the question on the engagement with — with Colombia.,So, from the beginning, it’s been extremely important to us that we — we maintain close contact and collaboration with a wide range of partners and allies on issues with respect to Venezuela.  And that inc- — certainly include- — includes those in the region, including Colombia.,And so, we have engaged with Colombia on this.  They are aware of and — and tracking, at a minimum, the difficulties that we’ve seen and our perspective on Venezuela’s overall compliance with the Barbados Agreement.,And then, I’ll share with my colleague [redacted] for any other perspective.  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Nothing to add.,OPERATOR:  Okay.  We’ll go ahead and take our next question.,Q    Hi, this is Rafael Rojas from BBC Mundo.  I wanted to ask whether you had any information on the possible facts, going back to the previous question, that Colombia might play a role as an overseer in the election.  And what — what news does the U.S. have on — on a role of overseer from the partners in the Venezuelan election?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, we support the presence of international electoral observers in Venezuela, and we understand that Colombia has been invited to send observers for the process.  That would be in addition to the invitations to the European Union and the Carter Center and other organizations.,Having an international presence we consider positive.  Colombia, as a border country to Venezuela, has important relationships and interests.  That means that their engagement is something that’s important to the Colombian government and people.  And I think it can be a positive impact on — on the way forward toward a more democratic Venezuela.,OPERATOR:  Moving to the next caller.,Q    Yes.  Hello, this is Matt Spetalnick with Reuters.  So, a couple questions, please.  What, if any, considerations were given in the sanctions decision on the impact it might have on spurring higher global oil prices, including at the pump in the U.S., and on the number of Venezuelan migrants flowing to the U.S.-Mexico border?,And separately from that, is the administration leaving in place the separate license that removed the secondary trading ban on certain Venezuelan sovereign bonds (inaudible) PDVSA’s debt equity?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’ll take the first part of that.  So, in making this determination of whether or not Venezuelan authorities were in compliance with the Barbados Agreement, we really focused on the political circumstances and situation in Venezuela.,But, of course, there was an interagency process that accompanied this that was able to bring in a wider array of interest and issues, which were, of course, part of the overall context of this — of this decision.  But fundamentally, the decision was based on the — the actions and non-action of the Venezuelan authorities.,OPERATOR:  And we’ll take the next caller now.,Q    Thank you for this opportunity.  I’m Carla Angola from (inaudible) Network, and my question is: The extent of the authorization for Chevron in Venezuela arose from agreements in Mexico, which were part of a concession to the Maduro regime to motivate them to sit at a negotiating table.  Are those Chevron licenses going to be reviewed as well?  In any case, what is the difference between that license and License 44 if Maduro’s failure to comply with the agreements is the same?,And regarding the hostage exchanges with the Maduro regime, when Alex Saab was sent to Venezuela, Madura released arrest warrants against members of María Corina Machado’s Vente Venezuela political party.  But three months later, Maduro reissued those arrest warrants against them.  And today, they are either in a prison or torture center, or they are taking refuge in an embassy.,It looks like you handed over Alex Saab in exchange for no one, because those people are still persecuted today.  How serious is it for you?  That seems to have been just a disguise by the Maduro regime.  Thank you so much.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  [Senior administration official], do you want to take the first part, and I’ll take the second part?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  Happy to do it, [senior administration official].  So, on — on the question about the Chevron-related license — that’s General License 41 — as we’ve said before in — in evaluating this most recent batch of sanctions relief that came in October, what we’ve said is that we would look at that and any calibrations to it, up or down, to be proportional with the progress made under the Barbados Agreement.,And so, I would just say: Recall that the Chevron predated that by a period of time, and that was a base-level commitment to reengage in the talks, which did happen.  And so, this — this decision point, which is, you know, with the commitments under Barbados and since October, has there been a meeting of those commitments, and, if not, what is our proportional response, that’s what you see today in the issuing of the wind-down.,MODERATOR:  [Senior administration official], did you want to take the next other part?,OPERATOR:  I’m looking at the line here.  We may have lost [senior administration official].,Oh, yes, I see he’s reconnecting now.  Just a moment.,MODERATOR:  Could we go to the next question and maybe come back if he can answer that second part of the question?,OPERATOR:  Certainly.,MODERATOR:  Thanks.,OPERATOR:  We’ll go ahead and take the next caller for now.,Q    Hello, it’s Michael Stone here from the Financial Times.  Thank you for doing this.  I understand that the Chevron license continues intact, but could you clarify whether the licenses that were issued to Trinidad and Shell for gas and to Repsol and Maurel & Prom for oil, whether those also continue or whether those have been canceled?,And, secondly, what impact do you believe the totality of the package announced today is going to have on Venezuelan oil production and output over the coming months?  What sort of reduction will there be as a result of these measures?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Gotcha.  This is [senior administration official].  I’m happy to take the — the first part.,I think you’ve asked about a couple of different items that may have come in.  As I mentioned in my, sort of, opening remarks, we have two types of licenses that we give.  Some are general licenses.  Those are public.  But we also allow individual parties with particular fact patterns that ask to come in, and we evaluate them on a case-by-case basis for specific licenses.  And those are — are non-public and protected through — through law, as far as discussing the details of them, although the — any party that submits that can release that.,So, I don’t have more to share on those particular items related to specific parties.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey, this is [senior administration official].  My — I got dropped from the call earlier, but I’m back.,OPERATOR:  Okay.  [Senior administration official], did you want to address the portion of the question that you were going to?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Happy to do so.  So, we are very concerned about the arrest of Henry Alviarez and Dignora Hernández and the issuance of arrest warrants for seven other advisors to María Corina Machado, the harassment of opposition members, and the detention of other civil society actors, including Rocío San Miguel.,We are continuing to raise those issues with the other side.  But we’re also proud that, through this process, we’re able to obtain the release of six wrongfully detained American citizens, to secure the release of and return of others who are in jail in Venezuela, including the return of a fugitive from justice from the United States.,We continue to believe that the Barbados Agreement represents the only important and viable path forward, but the other side has failed to comply with its obligations.  And for that reason, we’ve taken the steps that we’re taking today.,And we will continue to talk to our friends and allies and make common cause with them to try to secure the release of all those who are wrongfully detained or arrested or jailed in Venezuela for expressing their fundamental human rights and civic rights in that country.,OPERATOR:  Okay.  We’ll go ahead and take the next caller here.,Q    Hi.  Good morning.  Thank you so much for doing this.  I have a question.  Does President Biden continue to believe in Nicolás Maduro’s goodwill as it has been described on several occasions before?  And will this administration change or is trying to change its current policy on Venezuela?,And, also, what are the concerns about the — just (inaudible) on that question about immigration, what are the concerns of the Biden administration on an eventual increase of Venezuela migrants arriving at the border due to a possible outcome of the elections in July?,Thank you.  And Jorge with Voice of America.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’ll take the first crack at that.  So, the — the Biden administration remains very committed to and focused on ensuring a restoration of democracy in Venezuela and — and working to see that the upcoming elections that will take place there later this year are as free and fair and competitive — as competitive as they — they can possibly be.,And, of course, we’re very attuned as well for the welfare of the Venezuelan people and would prefer to see a situation where the people in Venezuela are able to live in a prosperous and secure setting and certainly not suffer the humanitarian challenges and the deep insecurity that — that exists today.,And so, that’s — that’s our overall objective.  That’s what we’re focused on.  We do believe that securing greater space for political freedom and for this election to be as democratic as it can possibly be an important step towards that.,With respect to some of the broader issues that you raise, of course, we are very aware of the migration flows that have emanated from Venezuela over the past several years.  Those flows are not only affecting the United States, but they’ve really had broad impacts across the region, including in Venezuela’s close neighbors, such as Colombia and Brazil, and other parts of Latin America and Central America.,And so, this administration is also very committed to working cooperatively with our partners throughout the hemisphere on migration management to make sure that it’s more effective, that it’s humane, and that the need for people to or desire for people to cross their borders without documentation can be vastly reduced.  That’s something that we are working on with all of our partners in the region.  And that is something that will remain a priority for the Biden administration.,OPERATOR:  Okay.  I believe we have time for one more question.  We’ll go ahead and take the next caller here.,And, caller, you can go ahead.  Please make sure that your device is also unmuted.,Q    Okay.  Sorry.  Hi, Juan Carlos López from CNN Español.  Thank you for the call.,So, there were recent meetings between the U.S. and Venezuela and Mexico.  There was also meetings between Colombia and Venezuela.  Is there anything the Venezuelan government, the Maduro government, can do from here to May 31st to reverse this decision?  Or is this decision a sign that there is no going forward with them?,And what happens if these elections go forward?  Do you have any leverage that you can use against Venezuela?  And on the license that was — that is not being renewed, since you don’t know figures, does that license benefit any American companies, or would that only benefit the Venezuelan government?,Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’ll take the — the first part of the question.  So, we’ve been very committed to engaging with a wide range of Venezuelan stakeholders to try to move and to help move the political process forward in Venezuela.  And that includes, at certain junctures, direct engaging with the Venezuelan authorities.  Certainly, it includes maintaining a constant level of communication with Venezuelan civil society, opposition figures, with partner nations in the Western Hemisphere, and partners more broadly, internationally.,And so, that is — that is going to remain our focus.,With respect to the current General License 44 that we are discussing, this was a license that was granted for six months and had an expiration date.  And so, this was a question that we had to address, essentially, today and over the past several days and weeks of whether or not the progress that has taken place in Venezuela merits the renewal of the license.,We determined that Venezuela has thus far fallen short of its commitments in terms of opening up the democratic and electoral process and, therefore, made the decision not to renew the license and to allow it to expire, as my colleagues have described.  However, that does not mean that we are not going to still continue to engage in a constructive and pragmatic way to try to move the election back towards a better course.,And I think there’s some near-term decisions that the Venezuelan authorities will be taking that we will be watching and monitoring very carefully.  We also realize that members of the political opposition and various political parties have decisions of their own to make, and we are committed to ensuring that we have the best and most relevant understanding of the political process in Venezuela and that we’re working with our partners internationally to ensure that the will of the Venezuelan people can be heard at the ballot box when an election takes place later this year.,MODERATOR:  Thank you very much.,Thanks again to everyone for joining the call today.  Thanks, [Operator], for all your support.,As a reminder for everyone, this call was on background for attribution to “senior administration

He and I served together in the U.S. Senate, as respective chairs of the Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees in the wake of 9/11, working to heal a shattered nation and to protect America in a changing world. Bob stood on principle against the Iraq War. He cosponsored my landmark Violence Against Women Act, transforming the way our nation responds to domestic abuse and sexual assault. He was committed to education and to the environment, continuing work that he’d begun as governor to support public schools and universities, and to protect the water supply, wetlands, and wildlife of Florida’s iconic Everglades. He was full of humor and humanity, and I’m grateful for the support that he gave me over the years.,Bob loved people, and he knew that politics at its core is about learning from and serving others. That’s why he spent more than 400 “workdays” on the job with constituents, doing everything from picking tomatoes, to handling baggage, to patrolling the streets with police. He knew it matters to walk a mile in other folks’ shoes. In recent years, he sought to instill that same ethic and empathy in a new generation of public servants through his center in Gainesville, and by working to require civics classes in public schools. He inspired his own daughter, Gwen, to serve in Congress as well; and I’m proud to have her in my Administration today, as an Assistant Secretary of Education. Bob was so proud, too.,Our hearts today are with Bob’s beloved wife of 65 years, Adele; with their four daughters, Gwen, Cissy, Suzanne, and Kendall; with their grandchildren and friends; and with the people of Florida, whom Bob served so well in so many ways for so long.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",17-04-24,Statement from President Joe Biden on the Passing of Former U.S. Senator and Florida Governor Bob Graham,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/17/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-passing-of-former-u-s-senator-and-florida-governor-bob-graham/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,National Security Council,Via Teleconference,(April 14, 2024),MODERATOR:  Thank you so much.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Sorry for the delayed start, and thanks for joining the call.,As a reminder, this call is on background and it’s embargoed until the completion of the call.,For your awareness, not for your reporting, on the call today we have [,senior administration official,].  He will be a “senior administration official” on the call.  We have [senior Defense official], who will be our “,senior Defense official,.”  And [senior military official], who will be our “,senior military official,.”,Our speakers will have a few words at the top, and we’ll turn it over to Q&A.,With that, [senior administration official], I’ll turn it over to you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  So, I’m going to go through just kind of an opening and talk a little bit about not only what happened last night, but also really over the last 10 days of preparation and try to give a little bit of color, then turn it over to my DOD colleagues.  Then, I’m happy to take some Q&A.,So, last night, as you know, Iran conducted an unprecedented attack on the state of Israel with over 300 munitions, including, remarkably, over 100 ballistic missiles, as well as land-attack cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles.,President Biden, probably about 10 days ago now, had instructed all of us — the United States to defend Israel to the maximum extent possible and defeat the attack, ensuring all authorities were in place, all assets were in place.  And now that the attack has concluded, that’s exactly what we did as a country.,With the support of a number of partners, including the UK and France, the United States enabled Israel to spectacularly defeat this unprecedented attack.,Despite launching over 300 munitions from Iran and other points in the region, Israel and a coalition of partners were able to defeat 99 percent of these munitions.  There’s virtually no infrastructure damage to Israel at all.,And just for context, President Biden is the first American president to directly defend Israel.  He followed and directed, really, every detail of this response, starting nearly two weeks ago as we began to receive word and indications that Iran was preparing for a large-scale attack.,Iran’s intent clearly was to cause significant damage and deaths in Israel.  We believe this requires an unequivocal condemnation from the international community.  The President this morning convened the G7, and they have forcefully condemned the attack.  I think that statement is now out.,And all the leaders on that call were totally united in the condemnation of Iran and the need to hold Iran to account for this unprecedented and defeated assault, and also the support for the defense of Israel was very much unanimously stated by all the leaders on that call, which I was on here earlier this morning.,We’ve been mindful in the preparations that led to last night that if successful, this attack could have caused an uncontrollable escalation of broad regional conflict — something we have worked day and night to avoid since October 7th, over the past six months.,I mentioned in the last 10 days of preparations.  And just to provide some examples: In addition to the forced posture adjustments, which we can discuss, administration officials have been in constant, ongoing, continuous contact with Israelis, with other partners in the region, as well as Iran with a series of direct communications through the Swiss channel and other relevant players in anticipation of the events that transpired last night.,Secretary Austin — and I think my colleague can talk more about this — had regular consultations, obviously, with his Israeli counterparts — other counterparts throughout the region; Secretary Blinken, counterparts throughout the region, as well as Turkey and China; the chairman with his Israeli counterpart and others; Jake Sullivan, myself with Israelis up and down the system almost constantly.,Even last night, just as the attack was underway before we went to join the President, Ambassador Mike Herzog and the Israeli Defense Attaché visited me here at the White House to kind of walk through where we were, even as the attack was underway.,Constant engagements with G7, Quad, Gulf counterparts and, again, Chinese, Indians, Iraqis.  This was an ongoing effort over the last 10 days.,And, of course, General Kurilla, our CENTCOM commander, was in the region, able to provide real-time updates and, of course, in very close coordination with the Israelis and all of our other partners.,So, all along, President Biden was kept updated by his national security team — multiple times a day, really, over the last 10 days or so — behind the scenes of other events.,For example, preparations for what we believe was coming were continuous and ongoing.  Just one example: On the margins of the Japanese Prime Minister’s visit, Secretary Austin and Jake briefed the President on the possibility for additional military deployments, including an additional missile destroyer, which the President immediately authorized.,Yesterday, of course, the President returned from Delaware and then gathered with his team throughout the evening in the Situation Room as events unfolded in real time.  So, he was in the Situation Room getting real-time updates as this unfolded, including at the time of missile launches.,And just to kind of set the scene, I mean, at one point, we knew there were over 100 ballistic missiles in the sky — a very short period of travel time to Israel — a period of, really, minutes.  And the results of the defenses, of course, were unclear until all was said and done.,As the results of the defenses came in, which is when we knew the preparations and planning had succeeded, there was a bit of — a bit of relief.  But you can imagine those tense moments.,And at nine — nine o’clock p.m., the President spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu.  And, again, just to set this scene, he, of course — the Prime Minister is with his — his War Cabinet in the war room as this was also unfolding in real time for them.  So, you know, the context for that call — it was shortly after we believed the attack was largely defeated.  The President reaffirmed our unwavering support for Israel’s defense.,But, again, the context for the call, I think, keep in mind, both leaders had just gone through the 10 days of preparations and then the results, which were just becoming to be known, and we were feeling pretty good about where we were.,But he told — the President told the Prime Minister that Israel really came out far ahead in this exchange.  Israel took out the IRGC’s — the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ leadership in the Levant.  Iran tried to respond, and Israel had clearly demonstrated its military superiority, defeating this attack, particularly in coordination with — with partners — first and foremost, the United States and others.,This morning, we met the President here early in the Situation Room — Jake Sullivan, Secretary Blinken, Jon Finer, myself, and others — again, to review the results of the attack.  The President spoke with the G7 leaders, as I mentioned, followed by a call with King Abdullah.,The President and King Abdullah obviously go back many, many years, and the President values his wisdom and counsel.  And they talked about kind of broader regional situation and a number of broader issues.,The President then spoke with [redacted], the commander of the 494th Fighter Squadron, a unit based in the UK, and [redacted], commander of the 335th Fighter Squadron unit from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina.  These two squadrons had dozens of aerial takedowns last night, saving lives, reducing the risk of a broad regional conflict.,The President expressed his thanks as their Commander-in-Chief for, really, their extraordinary airmanship and skill that was displayed throughout this multi-hour engagement over the course of last night.,As for Iran, the President has been cleared — clear that their actions end here, and the same applies to Iran’s proxies.  If they take action against us, we are fully prepared to defend our people, our interests, and to hold Iran accountable, as we have shown a number of times over the last six months of this crisis.,And just to conclude, I think the events of the last 10 days have demonstrated that while we may have some disagreements, the United States of America stands with Israel, and there’s no question that we will come to their defense when they are attacked.  Last night demonstrated that fact.  And when the President — what the President calls an ironclad commitment for the United States is just that.  And I think we showed that last night in real time in a truly unprecedented manner.,So, with that, I think I will end the opening, turn it over to my DOD colleagues.  Then I’m happy to take questions.,SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  Good afternoon.  This is [senior Defense official] as the senior defense official.,So, just to add a couple of notes to [senior administration official]’s opening: Over the last 48 hours, Secretary Austin has been receiving regular updates from his senior commanders and staff concerning Iran’s attack against Israel.  Throughout the weekend, the Secretary was in close communication with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of Israel.  In addition, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been in touch with the IDF Chief of Staff, General Halevi.  And, of course, CENTCOM Commander, General Kurilla, is in the region and has been in continued contact with his Israeli counterparts as well.,I think [senior administration official] cited the unprecedented nature of this attack against Israel.  Over 300 munitions, including over 100 ballistic missiles, as well as cruise missiles and UAVs.  These attacks were launched from locations in Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen against Israeli territory.  And it was the first-ever direct attack on Israel from Iran — from Iranian soil.,So, the Secretary, the Chairman, and other senior leaders from the Department joined the National Security Council from the White House in — in monitoring events in real time, as — as [senior administration official] described.,Following the end of the attack, the Secretary again spoke with Minister Gallant and reinforced the U.S. ironclad commitment to Israel’s defense.,In coordination with the Israeli government, U.S. forces in the Middle East successfully intercepted many of these missiles and UAVs targeting Israel.  My colleague will detail some of the — the numbers.,We are incredibly grateful here in the Department of Defense for the professionalism and skill of the brave U.S. troops who took part in these actions and who continue to stand guard to prevent further conflict or escalation.,Iran’s attack is completely unacceptable and reckless and risks dragging the region into broader conflict.  These attacks also violated the airspace of neighboring Arab countries.,So, let me be clear: Iran intended to cause significant damage in Israel, and they failed in their mission to do so, which is a testament to Israel’s military superiority and our collective defense.,It’s undoubtedly a team effort, and with the support of our partners, we — together with the Israelis — were able to defeat this egregious attack.  And that was also made possible by decades’ worth of cooperation and investment in defense technologies.,Our goal remains to de-escalate immediately and halt any further attacks.  We do not seek conflict with Iran, but we will not hesitate to act to protect our forces and support the defense of Israel.  And the President and the Secretary have been very clear that our support for Israel’s defense is ironclad and our forces remain postured to provide further support for Israel’s defense and to protect U.S. troops in the region.,I’ll now turn it over to the joint staff for further operational updates.,SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL:  Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for joining this call.  This is [senior military official].,As mentioned earlier, we currently assess Iran launched more than 300 air threats to include more than 100 medium-range ballistic missiles, more than 30 land-attack cruise missiles, and more than 150 one-way attack drones towards Israel.,Also, as mentioned earlier, we currently assess there is no significant damage within Israel itself.,At the direction of the President and the Secretary of Defense, U.S. forces assigned to U.S. Central Command and U.S. European Command actively engaged a number of the threats.,The USS Arleigh Burke and USS Carney, operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, engaged and destroyed between four and six Iranian ballistic missiles during the attack.  U.S. alert aircraft in the region shot down more than 70 Iranian one-way UAVs headed toward Israel.,A U.S. Army Patriot missile battery shot down one ballistic missile in the vicinity of Erbil, Iraq, assessed to be en route to Israel.  It is assessed that that missile was not targeting U.S. or coalition forces.,There were no U.S. casualties or damage, and our forces remain postured to provide additional defensive support to protect U.S. forces in the region.,And I’ll be happy to take your questions.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  [Operator], if you could remind folks on how to queue up for questions, we’ll take your questions now.,[Operator provides instructions.],OPERATOR:  First person in our queue is Zeke Miller from the AP.  Please, go ahead.,Q    Good afternoon.  Thank you for doing the call.  I was hoping you could give us a sense of what you were expecting next from the Israelis?  What has been the U.S. messaging to the Israelis about taking their own retaliation against Iran?,And then in terms of the G7, was there any agreement on any sort of specific sanctions or other consequences that the international community, that the U.S. wants to emplace on Iran in the days ahead?,And any additional messaging since this attack between the U.S. and Tehran, either through the Swiss channel or any — any others?  What would the nature of that messaging be?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me try to — try to break those down.  On the G7, there was a discussion — a fairly detailed — a fairly detailed and, I think, constructive discussion about Iran.  And I don’t want to speak for, obviously, the other capitals, but a discussion of some of those countries designate — designating the IRGC as a terrorist group — things like that — but also a coordinated effort on some sanctions measures that we had been discussing.  Some of the things that had hit some hurdles that I think we’re going to look to — look to move forward on, but I don’t want to get ahead of that process.,It was discussed in some detail, and I think we have a decent way forward.  And I think the statement that the — I believe, the Italians have — have it out — speaks to some of that.  But so, that’ll be coming.,You know, on the Israelis, look, we are committed to defending Israel.  We would not be a part of any — of any response they do.  That’s very consistent policy.,The discussion between the leaders last night, again, was in the context of just having come through this incredibly intense period of hours and, I thought, a pretty good discussion about kind of where you go from here and different — kind of calculating appropriately.,But I think John Kirby spoke to this as well today, and I think I’ll leave it at that.,Our aim is to de-escalate regional tensions.  We do not want a broader regional conflict, but our focus has been to contain this crisis to Gaza.  That’s been a focus since October 7th.  That remains the focus.,And part of our efforts, of course, in helping Israel — in the defense of Israel is just about that.  Helping to defend Israel — that is something that remains — I know it’s overstated, but it’s actually true — ironclad.  I mean, that is a true statement.  And I think what you — what you saw last night is what that means in practice.  We were ready for that.  We’re prepared.  And we’ll do it again if we have to.,The Iranians did send us a message, but I don’t want to characterize it one way or the other.  We have decent ways to communicate with them, but I think we are speaking very publicly and openly about what happened last night and that there needs to be some consequences here.  And I think that was a — that was a good subject of discussion with our G7 counterparts.,OPERATOR:  Our next question is Jennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg.,Q    Hey.  Thanks, everybody.  Two things.  Hello, this is J.J., Jennifer Jacobs, from Bloomberg News.  On the 100 ballistic missiles that were in the air at the same time, if you guys could offer any more details on that — on how you went about countering that, just any inside details would be appreciated.,And then also, as you push for de-escalation, what options is the U.S. steering Israel towards?  Can you say like, you know, are you making, you know, suggestions for alternative routes for them?  Thanks very much.,SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL:  This is senior military official.  With regard to the ballistic missile attack, it was a substantial number — as pointed out, more than 100 at one single time.  It was a, you know, extremely phenomenal display of the defensive capability of Israel in this regime.,They were of course supported by U.S. forces, in particular our two destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean.  The targeting and ultimate shots that are taken are deconflicted between the U.S. and Israel in these sorts of engagements, but the overwhelming majority of those intercepts of ballistic missiles was by Israeli systems.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, just on Israel, Jennifer, I don’t think I’m going to go much deeper than I’ve — than I’ve said.  I mean, look, we — we were — when the Israelis were here, we had a meeting on the Rafah process that we kicked off about two weeks ago, and it was shortly after — shortly before that meeting began that we actually had a VTC with the Israelis on their side, but we had the Israeli Ambassador here and their Defense Attaché here in the White House.,When we learned of their — of their strike in Damascus against the IRGC Levant leadership corps — and, of course, that leadership corps is focused on organizing regular and ongoing attacks against Israel.  But we — Jon Finer, myself, and Jake — were pulled aside to be informed specifically about details of that strike.  We were not a part of that strike, obviously.,But we didn’t — we knew that that would have repercussions, and that kind of has played out here over the last — over the last two weeks.,I think Israel has made clear to us they’re not looking for a significant escalation with Iran.  That’s not what they’re looking for.  They’re looking to protect themselves and defend themselves.  And so, that’s an ongoing discussion we’re having with the Israelis, but I don’t want to talk about specific pathways or anything else.,I just think the President was very clear that we’re going to help defend Israel.  And he made very clear to the Prime Minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically about, you know, the risks of escalation.  And that’s something I think has been an ongoing conversation here with the Israeli side and others even throughout the — throughout today.,OPERATOR:  We have Andrea Mitchell from NBC News.,Q    Hi.  [Senior administration official], this is Andrea Mitchell from NBC News.  [Senior administration official] and [senior Defense official] and [senior military official] —,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey, Andrea.  How are you?,Q    Hi.  First of all, could you tell us whether you think that they decided not to strike back, as has been reported by the New York Times, after the President’s call?  Do you think that there was a cause and effect?,And participating in the call as you did, did you think — from hearing the call, did you — did you think after that call that they were going to strike back?  If you — even if it weren’t — if it wasn’t cause and effect, but did you think that they made that decision partly influenced by the President’s call?,And how much of a risk do you think it would be if they do take such steps now, given some of the regional partners with whom you’ve dealt and obviously had some quiet cooperation?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think, Andrea — I mean, I have not seen that report.  Again, Israel here will make its — make its own decisions.  But we made our views known.  And I think the President — again, this call came at a moment in which we had just gone through this incredibly intense period of time.  And from the Israeli side, I mean, they were living through the same thing in real time, knowing that there are 100 ballistic missiles on their way to Israel.,So, it’s a — it’s a period of kind of heightened emotion.  And I think the President, you know, had a discussion about trying to slow things down, think through things; given what we just went through, let’s assess kind of where we are.,And in the light of day, as the sun came up this morning in Israel — and Jack Lew actually visited one of the Arrow counter- — counter-missile batteries with Israel’s Minister of Defense to kind of review the aftermath.  And I think the kind of spectacular success — I don’t use that word lightly — really — really became known in the light of day.  I mean, when you could really see that there was almost no damage at all, took down almost all of these things, it’s extraordinary.,And I think when a call was — took place last night, when the President was in the Situation Room and we had been there for a period of hours, we knew we had largely defeated the attack, but the full extent of the — of how successful it was was not fully known.  And I think it was a very useful call just to kind of talk through where we are and next steps.  And, you know, nobody wants to run up the escalation ladder here.,So, on the one hand, this is an unprecedented Iranian attack, as we’ve said a number of times.  It was also an extraordinary feat of military prowess and cooperation with partners in defeating it.  And I think Israel has to think through carefully what it does next, but as I said in my opening, I think, you know, they’ve kind of gotten the best of it here.  That’s very much our — our view.,SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  This is the senior defense official.  I’ll just add one thought to that.  You know, as I mentioned in my opening, the success that was achieved was, in part, the product of years of investment and cooperation in developing these missile defense technologies, including the ones that Ambassador Lew visited.,And one of the great advantages of these technologies is not only, of course, the lives they save and the damage they prevent in defeating attacks, but in the flexibility they give leaders in how to respond to these situations.,And so, that’s — that’s been borne out by the success of — of their missile defenses and ours that — that were additive.  And, of course, all the work that all the participants in the defense of Israel did last night is that it creates space and flexibility for decisions on next steps.,OPERATOR:  Our next question is from Jeff Mason from Reuters.,Q    Hi.  Thanks very much.  Can you gentlemen confirm that,Iran gave a 72-hour heads-up to other countries in the region about its attack?  And did it do the same to the United States through the conversations that you referenced with regard to Switzerland?,And do you interpret that heads-up as a — as a sign that they wanted — that they were not looking for escalatory action or that they were — well, I guess my question is: How would you interpret that heads-up?,And, lastly, if I can add one more, can you confirm that the President told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the United States would not participate in a counteroffensive?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  On Iran, no, that is absolutely not true.  We — they did not give a notification, nor did they give any sense of, you know, “These will be the targets, so evacuate them.”  They were clearly intending to destroy and to cause casualties.  That was their intent.,And the fact that they didn’t, I think they might want to now say that, “Well, we didn’t mean to.”  But you launch 100 mis- — 100 ballistic missiles, you know, targeting certain locations, that was clearly their — their intent.  They just didn’t succeed.  And so, no, there was no such forewarning or anything like that.,They were very clear that so- — you know, they would be responding and that was, you know, clearly going to happen.  The level, scope of it was something that was discussed throughout the week.  Their Foreign Minister would say something completely different than others, which is not an uncommon practice with them.,But no, there was no kind of, like, warning as a way to kind of fire missiles but somehow not hurt anybody.  That was not — that was not their intent.,Sorry, your second question?,Q    The second ques- —,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah.,Q    The second question was about the call and whether President Biden said to Prime Minister Netanyahu that the U.S. would not participate in a counteroffensive.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, yeah.  I think that’s — again, (inaudible) going back to the Damascus strike, for example, we had nothing to do with that.  You know, we — we believe Israel has freedom of action to protect itself and defend itself in Syria or elsewhere.  That’s a common — that’s a longstanding policy, and that remains.  But, no, we would not envision ourselves participating in such a thing.,OPERATOR:  Our next question is from Peter Baker with The New York Times.,Q    Oh, hi, guys.  Just to follow up on Jeff’s question.  The — putting aside the idea of a 72-hour notice, they certainly telegraphed publicly for more than a week that they were going to do this.  Everybody knew they were going to do this.  You all had those 10 days to get forces in the region.  I mean, does that not tell us anything?,And in terms of the scope of what they did fire — more than 300 missiles and drones — is that on the high end, low end of what you expected?  What was your anticipation?  How do you — how do you — what context do you see that — that?  And do you think they still have plenty of munitions still to go, or what — does this deplete their ability to continue further attacks?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, Peter, I think it’s fair to say the scope of this attack is on the high end.  Launching 100 medium-range ballistic missiles — over 100, that is definitely on the high end, and makes it harder to defeat — to defeat when you have that many missiles in the sky.,And, again, I think it was due to the preparations, everything else.  I don’t think that the characterization is Iran gave us time to prepare.  They needed the time to prepare for themselves to do this.,So, we — we took advantage of the time from the moment we had any sort of information something could be coming.  We got assets in place.  We got coordination in place.  And my DOD counterparts can talk more to this, but a truly extraordinary level of military coordination to be prepared for this — I mean, unbelievable.,And what General Kurilla did and everything else, in getting our assets in place and the President making sure we had all the authorities, everything in place, good to go — you know, my counterpart here in this call talking multiple times throughout — every day throughout the week, making sure everything was — was ready.  But until — you know, until it comes, you never — you never fully know.,But just to kind of put a period on this: yeah, the high end, in my view.,And we used the time wisely to prepare.  And I think — but I would not characterize it as if Iran gave us the time to prepare.  Their intent was clearly to be highly, highly destructive.  And that is in their public rhetoric, and I think it’s borne out by what they tried to do last night.,OPERATOR:  Our next question is from Yuna Leibzon from Channel 12 News Israel.,Q    Thank you.  Yuna Leibzon from Channel 12 News Israel.  So, just following up on previous questions about the call and the message that the U.S. will not participate.  What exactly did the President say about any response from Israel?,On one hand, we hear that there is an understanding that there’s supposed to be some sort of response, no escalation.  But what was the exact term that was used for the U.S. and its support or not support for an Israeli response to this attack?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, so sorry.  I think — no surprise — first, I don’t have direct notes or a transcript in front of me, and I wouldn’t provide the exact terms, in any case, of the call.,I think — I think I’ve described the call.  I think John spoke to the call this morning.  And we read out the call last night with the President’s statement.  So, I think it was very clear.,I mean, of the — I would also say their last call 10 days or so ago, which had a number of issues to it — including, obviously, the situation in Gaza — humanitarian situation — the first issue discussed on the call was indications of this potential attack.  So, this has been ongoing communication with the Israelis from — from that level, but also through — through our systems.,But last night, as I’ve mentioned, was really coming out of the immediate aftermath of the attack, kind of assessing where we were and thinking through carefully about the next steps.  So, I’m not going to characterize it beyond that.,OPERATOR:  Our next question is from Gordon Lubold from The Wall Street Journal.,Q    Hi there.  I wondered, [senior administration official], particularly, if you could just expand a little bit on how you brought this coalition together — a little bit of color would be welcome — in the last 10 days or whatever, as you began to see what — what was imminent.,And, also, a little bit more about what General Kurilla’s role was in Israel the last 48 hours.  What was — what was his message?  How did he coordinate?  Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think anytime you’re talking about a coalition action, every capital has different legal standards, authorities.  And to make sure all of that is in place is — takes a, you know, military diplomatic effort.,Here, I think we had the French and the — and the Brits were obvi- — they fly with us in — in this theater all the time and — and were very — very clearly ready.  But then also bringing in our additional assets and then ensuring everything was coordinated, that’s really done at a — at a mil-mil level.  And then kind of, you know, who takes down what and the organization for the defense was really done at a — at a military-to-military level.,From time to time, there’d have to be political engagement in capitals, but also make sure we had all the accesses we need and everything else in order to — to defeat what we thought — thought to be a large-scale attack.  And as I mentioned in response to Peter’s question, this was on the high end, I think, of what we were — what we were anticipating.,But I don’t know if my DOD colleagues might have — might have more.,SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  Well, this is the senior defense official here.  Secretary Austin was in, you know, pretty much daily contact with General Kurilla, as were many of us and others throughout the CENTCOM system.  And it was really quite impressive to see the — the level of coordination and trust that that obviously requires between our CENTCOM colleagues and their Israeli counterparts.,General Kurilla was able to meet, as well, with Minister Gallant and other Israeli leaders to keep them informed about his coordination with their military.  And — but it — it gets down into very, very fine details of coordination to be able to execute what happened last night, as

senior administration official] sort of alluded to.,SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL:  Yeah, senior military official.  General Kurilla makes, you know, fairly routine visits to the region.  He has had an increased number of visits, you know, since October the 7th.,While in Israel, he ensured that we were — we were prepared to deconflict and coordinate our supporting efforts to the defense of Israel.  He also discussed with them our pending operations to support the delivery of humanitarian aid from the sea into Gaza.,But this was, you know, in light of Iranian rhetoric and to ensure that we were — we were best postured to support their defense.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’d just add, Gordon — I mean, it’s a good question, but to kind of — thinking through this, you know — one thing, we have a — we have a robust naval coalition, as you know, dealing with the Houthis.  And that has already provided a lot of, I think, the touchpoints, patterns of interaction, you need to be quite effective.,But, also, I just — I think — I don’t think I’ve mentioned on the call — I should have — the Houthis did try to engage last night.  But because we have that so well covered, I think we destroyed a ballistic missile on a launchpad.  And the other — other stuff they launched obviously did not make it to the target because we — we just have that area so well covered.  And that’s with a number of coalition partners.  So, what we’ve done there, we’ve done elsewhere — just standing mechanisms.,You know, there’s a — there’s a — between the Quad — with the French, the UK, and the Germans — I think Jake’s had a number of calls with his Quad counterparts to kind of coordinating this whole thing, particularly with the French and the Brits.  And then the — just the regular touchpoints between these capitals brought it together pretty quickly.,OPERATOR:  Next in queue is Liz Friden from Fox News.,Q    Thank you.  Jennifer Griffin here.  I’m just trying to understand.  You had a hundred ballistic missiles fired at Israel, and you say that four to six were shot down by naval assets in the eastern Med.  What shot down those other ballistic missiles, and was it, before it got in — they got into Israeli airspace?,And if you could talk a little bit about how many U.S. fighter jets or aircraft were involved in stopping these drones, et cetera.,SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL:  Yeah, this is senior military official.  The — the majority of those missiles were engaged by the Arrow system — Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 — in Israel — Israeli system.,The intercepts themselves took place not — not only over Israeli airspace, but over neighboring countries as well.  It was a — it was a pretty broad engagement zone.,There was, as you mentioned, between four and six — we’re still conducting analysis, but between four and six were confirmed by U.S. destroyers.  And then there was one that was confirmed by a U.S. Patriot battery as it flew near — in the vicinity of Erbil, Iraq.,And the number of — as far as the number of aircraft, I — I can’t get into the — into the specific numbers and, you know, reveal how many forces we had there.  But it was — it was a number of aircraft, both land-based and from — from the sea.,OPERATOR:  Our next question is from Alexander Marquardt from CNN.,Q    Thank you all for doing this.  [Senior administration official], I appreciate you don’t want to get into the specifics of — of the Iranian messaging, but I’m wondering if you could characterize how different it is — this is the direct message to the United States — how different that was in private to what we’ve heard in public — which was essentially, you know, “We’re done here,” and “The United States, don’t get involved” — and at what time or what stage in the process that messaging came in and whether there was a direct U.S. response in private back to Iran.,And if I may, could you give us a sense of how you think this is going to play into Israel’s plans for Rafah and the ongoing ceasefire talks, which feel like they’re going a bit round and around?  We have today this latest rejection by Hamas to the latest proposal.  Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Alexander.  Yeah.  So, we — we received a message from the Iranians as this was ongoing, through the Swiss, basically suggesting that they were finished after this, but it was still an ongoing attack.  So, that was their — that was their message to us.  I think they’ve said that publicly as well.,So, yeah, on — on Rafah, we have a process with the Israelis.  As we’ve discussed, I think, a number of times, I think, the complexities of Rafah, given Egypt, given the humanitarian dimension, given the density of the population there, given what it’s going to take, is extreme- — extraordinarily complex.  So, we have a process with them we kicked off about two weeks ago.,I think, obviously, this situation delayed that a little bit.  But we look forward to pick- — picking that back up as early as next — this coming week, as it’s important.  Our expert teams have been — have been working through it, particularly on the humanitarian side and — so that we can provide our — our input, which the Israelis have agreed to do.,They’ve also told us a number of times that anything there would be conditions-based, particularly with having the humanitarian situation set.  So, that’s a tall order of business.  And so, that’s something we’re continuing — continuing to work through.,But I don’t think there’s a direct — just to answer your question, how does this — how does one affect the other, I think, if anything, it — you know, attention has been focused on this — this most immediate threat.  But we will get back to the situation with the hostages.  We have to get the hostages out of Gaza.,It is outrageous that Hamas basically has an offer on the table that is everything they had asked for.  And I’m not going to confirm one w- — one way or the other what their response is, but pretty clear that Sinwar wants to hold hostages, including these young women, when releasing them and releasing old people and sick and wounded would result in an immediate ceasefire and all sorts of other things that are in this deal.,So, it really is — it kind of speaks to everything you need to know about Hamas.  I have to think that answers the question.,OPERATOR:  We have Alex Ward from Politico.,Q    Yes.  Hi.  I guess just to ask a question very directly: I mean, does the U.S. not want Israel to respond to Iran at this point?  Should — should Israel just not do anything and take the defensive success as the win?  Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’m just not going to say that so definitively.  I think it’s a — it’s a calculation the Israelis have to make.  This was an unprecedented attack from Iran against Israel.,At the same time, we think in the overall exchange here — as I said in my opening, I think that the Israelis came out clearly very much on top and demonstrated their ability to defend their country in coordination with us and others — speaks for itself.  And I think a big question is not only — not only whether but what Israel might choose to do.,And so, this is a decision — decision for them.  But I’m not going to answer it that specifically.  And I think the conversation between the President and the Prime Minister was really kind of thinking through strategically where we are after having just come through this very intense period of hours last night.  So, I’m not going to say that so definitively, no.,OPERATOR:  We have time for one more question.  We have Nadia Charters from Al Arabiya on the line.,Q    Thank you.  Nadia Bilbassy-Charters, Al Arabiya.  Do you all expect a new set of sanctions on Iran?  And, also, Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the political wing of Hamas, congratulated the Iranian regime, and there was reports that Sinwar was holding in the hostage deal, waiting for the Iranian attack.  So, I know you touched on it a little bit, but do you believe that this attack will make it harder or easier for Hamas leaders to negotiate?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Nadia.  Hamas has been, since October 7th, trying to ignite a regional war.  That is what they want to do.  They say it publicly, and we know that’s what they’re trying to do.,They have tried to do it through working with the Iranians.  They’ve tried to do it through Ramadan.  It’s in their public statements of what they tried to do and hope would — would happen over the course of Ramadan in Jerusalem.  It did not happen.,I think they hope this incident would have — do — do the same.  So, that is what they want and, again, speaks to what they’re trying to do.,Haniyeh was in Tehran about two weeks ago.  And, yeah, you know, they work closely together and coordinate.  And this is one reason why Israel faces very real threats from the IRGC and from the Houthis and from the proxies that are — you know, have a desire to encircle Israel.  And we’re going to ensure that they cannot succeed.,So, what I just said in my opening: Look, we have dif- — we have differences and disagreements with Israel on a number of things, including, in particular, on Gaza.  And those are things we’re continuing to work through.,But when it comes to the defense of Israel against Iran, as I said in my opening and as my DOD counterpart said, that commitment truly is ironclad.,And I think I’ll end the call with a point that I think we demonstrated that last night, and we will continue to do so going forward.,MODERATOR:  Thanks.  Thank you, everyone, for joining.  That’s all the time we have for today.,As a reminder, this call was on background, and the embargo is now lifted.,On this call today, we had a senior administration official, senior defense official, and senior military official.,Thanks, everyone.  Hope you have a good rest of your day.,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington," DC 20500""",14-04-24,Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on Iran’s Attacks Against the State of Israel,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/04/14/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-irans-attacks-against-the-state-of-israel/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,New York, New York,Thanks so much, Jason. It’s great to be with all of you today. I want to commend the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy for everything you do to advance the policy conversation on the most pressing global climate and clean energy issues.,We’re coming together at a moment when the realities of the climate crisis have never been more clear—and when our ability to address those realities has never been greater.,I. Climate Imperative,July of last year was the hottest month on record. 2023 was the hottest year on record. Last month was the hottest March on record.,And each month in between July and March was the hottest ever recorded on our planet.,Meanwhile, the ocean—which absorbs the majority of the Earth’s warming—has been shattering temperature records for over a year.,This isn’t a fluke—this is the climate crisis. And it’s affecting all corners of the globe.,Let’s just take one of the most common—and the most deadly—consequences: extreme heat.,According to a World Weather Attribution study, climate change made the scorching heat wave in West Africa in February ten times more likely.,Last year, one single heat event in India killed more than 100 people…and Iran hit a heat index of 152 degrees Fahrenheit or 67 degrees Celsius—nearing the limit for human survival.,Here in the United States, Phoenix had 31 straight days of temperatures at or above 110 degrees Fahrenheit last summer—contributing to nearly 600 deaths.,And in Europe—the fastest warming continent in the world—more than 61,000 people are estimated to have succumbed to the record-breaking summer heat of 2022.,These are not future projections. This is happening right now.,The economic toll in developed and developing countries alike is staggering.,Meanwhile, global emissions keep rising—reaching a record level last year.,While it’s true that we have made progress since Paris…we still have a lot more work to do to ensure a safe future for humanity.,II. Era of Climate Action,President Biden and Vice President Harris have taken on the climate crisis from Day 1…,By rejoining the Paris Agreement and making climate a top priority in international diplomacy…,By mobilizing a whole-of-government approach to cutting carbon pollution across every sector…in power…transportation …buildings…industry…agriculture and forestry…,And by passing the Inflation Reduction Act—the largest investment in climate and clean energy in history.,The law is unleashing private sector deployment of clean energy while boosting innovation to develop the next generation of technologies that we’ll need to get to net zero.,In the time that President Biden has been in office, private companies have announced over $380 billion in new clean energy investments.,And just since the IRA passed, over 270,000 clean energy jobs have been created across the nation.,All in all, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and strong new emission reduction standards in the power and transportation are putting America on a path to reach President Biden’s climate goal of cutting our carbon pollution in half by 2030.,Here in the United States, we’ve backed up our ambition with action—and we need to see that around the world as well.,New climate targets—Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs—are due to be submitted under the Paris Agreement early next year.,Those NDCs need to be aligned with a 1.5 degree world. And while ambitious NDCs are necessary, they are not sufficient.,They need to be backed up with domestic policies that spur innovation and accelerate deployment of clean energy in countries at all stages of development.,Even as we invest in America to build a clean energy economy—and even as we work with our allies and partners to build more resilient, secure clean energy supply chains—we have no intention of pulling the ladder up behind us.,Every,nation deserves the ability to build a clean energy economy that will protect its own citizens and support long-term growth…,The ability to build industries that can innovate, scale, and compete on a level playing field.,The ability to participate fully in building a clean energy future that prevents the worst impacts of climate change and protects the most vulnerable communities.,That’s why the United States will continue to drive a virtuous cycle of innovation and investment that lowers the cost of clean energy technologies in a fair and transparent way…,While at the same time we will continue to use our public and private dollars to support countries embarking on their own clean energy transitions—and continue to encourage multilateral institutions to make important reforms necessary to do the same.,I’ll have more to say about that in a minute.,III. The Trade Problem,But even as we increase investment at home and abroad, there’s still an elephant in the room…one that’s producing a lot of emissions…and that is global trade.,We have to take a serious look at our international economic systems, including trade—and harness them for climate action.,Our current global trading system was built to promote open and competitive markets—which it has done well—but it wasn’t built to curb emissions.,In fact, by many measures, global trade is a huge,contributor,to the climate problem.,Emissions from shipping and aviation are a major factor.,These emissions have received a lot of attention and they’ve been the subject of a lot of productive international cooperation to reduce emissions through the production of sustainable fuels and electrification where possible.,But we can’t just look at how we move goods around the world—we have to look at,what,goods we’re moving.,And when you seriously account for the emissions embodied inside tradable goods… the emissions from the production processes that create the commodities and manufactured products that we buy and sell on the global market… then traded goods account for about twenty-five percent of all global emissions.,To put it another way, if the global trade of goods was its own country, it would be the second-largest carbon polluter in the world after the PRC.,The United States alone imported over 1 gigaton of emissions from traded products—just in the year 2019. That’s the same amount of emissions we expect to reduce in 2030 thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.,This needs to change if we are to get the climate crisis under control.,Right now, our existing trade policies and the international rules that govern them don’t pay enough attention to the emissions embodied in tradeable goods.,We don’t have uniform standards or consistent, reliable data about embodied emissions.,Global trading rules incentivize carbon leakage—when manufacturing-related emissions from a country with stronger climate policies shift to a country with weaker policies.,There is no penalty for what I like to call carbon dumping—when high emissions in production are exported back into countries with stronger climate policies.,That’s bad news for climate.,It’s also bad news for competition—setting up a race away from robust, resilient, and diverse supply chains to those concentrated in countries with lax standards.,We have a system where transparent, well-structured, targeted incentives to spur fair market development and private-sector investment in clean energy are subject to challenge.,Meanwhile, countries collectively spent $1 trillion to subsidize fossil fuels in 2022 alone, and those policies have proven nearly impossible to eliminate despite near consensus on the need to.,Let me give you an example of what can happen when policy doesn’t take sufficient account of embodied carbon in tradeable goods.,The U.S. used to be the world’s largest producer of aluminum. But after decades of outsourcing and non-market behavior by some countries, only four primary aluminum smelters now remain in the U.S.,Today, over half of the world’s aluminum is made in China, where the average ton of aluminum produces 60% more emissions than it does in the U.S.,This is a bad story for the American workers who lost their jobs and the American communities that were hollowed out.,But it’s also bad for the world as a whole. Globally, aluminum production is substantially dirtier than it needs to be.,It’s what we call a “race to the bottom”—our relatively cleaner industrial base shrunk, while the emissions embodied in our imports swelled.,IV. Announcing Task Force,Instead, we need a smart, 21st century-approach to climate and trade policy that launches a “race to the top” for climate action…a global trading system that slashes pollution, creates a fair and level playing field, protects against carbon dumping, supports good manufacturing jobs and economic opportunity, and rewards every country that’s doing the right thing—no matter their stage of development.,We’re not claiming to have all the answers…but we’re ready to accelerate progress in turning conversations about climate-smart trade tools and policies into practice.,Today, we are announcing a new White House Climate and Trade Task Force, which will have three focus areas.,First, developing our climate and trade policy toolkit—with an open mind about what features and approaches will be most effective at addressing carbon leakage, carbon dumping, and embodied carbon in general.,We’re drawing on lessons we’ve learned from the ongoing negotiations, led by U.S. Trade Representative Katharine Tai, for a Global Arrangement on Steel and Aluminum between the EU and the US.,We’re open to proposals from our colleagues on Capitol Hill and policy thought leaders from inside and outside government.,We’re ready to deepen dialogue with our partners and allies around the world, from the UK to Australia to the EU as it pursues its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.,Second, the Task Force will focus on ensuring that we have credible, robust, and granular data to implement smart climate and trade policies.,We will work closely with trade partners to develop standardized and authoritative ways of measuring embodied emissions so that each country can harness comparative advantages in clean manufacturing.,And we’ll take steps internationally to promote common measurement and high standards on embodied emissions.,And third, the Task Force will identify what more we can do at home and abroad to further position producers to thrive in this new race-to-the-top environment.,Here in the U.S., we want our manufacturers to be the cleanest and most competitive in the world.,As part of that effort, we recently announced $6 billion in grants from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to reduce emissions from the industrial sector.,One of the awards will build a new green aluminum smelter that will avoid approximately 75 percent of the emissions of a conventional facility.,It will also be the first new smelter built in the United States in 45 years.,We will continue to build on the success of our Buy Clean Initiative, which harnesses the purchasing power of the federal government to boost lower-carbon construction materials.,And even as we continue our efforts to build out transmission and get clean energy projects up and running faster…we will also explore novel policy levers to help secure affordable supplies of clean electricity for energy-intensive manufacturers.,V. International Support,But we’re not just about positioning America to compete.,Everything we’re doing to implement the Inflation Reduction Act…deploy the clean energy that’s already available…and develop and scale newer technologies…all of that is increasing supply and lowering costs for the entire world.,The Boston Consulting Group projects that the Inflation Reduction Act will drive down the cost of certain clean energy technologies by as much as 25 percent.,It’s important to understand what the Inflation Reduction Act is,not,doing.,President Biden’s Investing in America approach is,not,intended to industrially target any sector, including the clean energy sector, in order to dominate the global market.,We are,not,over-subsidizing domestic industry at any cost, or creating an oversupply of clean energy products, or trying to drive competitors out of the market.,The fact that our transparent, well-structured, targeted incentives are now subject to a challenge at the WTO by the People’s Republic of China—which has spent decades engaged in non-market policies and practices that have distorted the global market for clean energy products like solar, batteries, and critical minerals—is beyond ironic.,Through the Inflation Reduction Act and other investments in clean energy—including strong support for research, development, and demonstration—we’re making clean energy technologies more accessible to more nations…speeding deployment…and lowering emissions globally…all while creating high-quality production and encouraging high labor standards.,The Rhodium Group found that for every ton of carbon pollution reduced at home because of the Inflation Reduction Act, we’ll slash up to 2.9 tons of carbon pollution outside of the U.S.,That’s in large part because of how our investments will lower costs for next-generation technologies like clean hydrogen electrolyzers.,In addition to creating benefits outside our borders, we’re supporting a range of international initiatives to support developing countries in securing the capital they need to decarbonize industry and invest in their clean energy future.,At COP28 in Dubai, Vice President Harris launched the Clean Energy Supply Chain Collaborative to work together with like-minded countries to create high-quality, secure, and diverse clean energy supply chains for several critical technologies, including batteries, electrolyzers, and sustainable aviation fuels.,We also announced up to $568 million in new lending from Treasury through the Clean Technology Fund to support clean energy projects in eligible countries.,Led by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the U.S. continues to support the important evolution of Multilateral Development Banks, including the World Bank, to effectively tackle 21,st,century global challenges like the climate crisis.,This is being discussed at the Spring Bank Meetings this week in D.C.,And as we approach COP29 at the end of this year, countries need to work together to set a new collective, quantified goal to boost global climate finance…moving beyond the $100 billion goal set at previous COPs.,We have an opportunity to reimagine a goal that’s ambitious…realistic…and that’s more effective in expanding the ecosystem of international, domestic, public, and private contributors.,We can draw some inspiration from the Convention on Biological Diversity framework that was agreed in Montreal in 2022—which focused on international support and mobilization while capturing the range of finance that is required to unlock the needed trillions in private sector investment.,We’re serious about supporting climate and trade policies that work domestically, crafted in partnership with the labor movement…the climate movement…U.S. industry…and Congress.,We’re serious about helping developing countries secure the financing and resources they need to build strong, sustainable economies.,And we’re serious about mobilizing a global coalition of partners and allies who are ready to build a modern international trade system that confronts the climate crisis head-on.,VI. Conclusion,As I see it, we have two choices.,We can maintain the status quo—a race to the bottom—with trade policies that reward countries that use dirty production and non-market practices to gain a competitive advantage.,Or, we can work together to create a race to the top in global trade…one that rewards countries that are leading on climate action through transparent, market-based policies and practices.,A system that’s coordinated…consistent…and sends a powerful market signal to countries and companies alike.,A new global dynamic where cutting emissions isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the only thing to do to compete and thrive.,The stakes couldn’t be higher.,But I believe if we make the right choice, we can create and maintain millions of good-paying jobs in the clean energy economy of the future…,We can mobilize billions in private investment in countries around the world…,We can maximize the impact of billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded domestic and international climate investments…,We can accelerate technological innovation and position nations to overcome the challenges of today and tomorrow…,And we can protect our planet for ourselves and for our children.,All of this is possible—as long as we do it together.,So let’s start today. Thank you.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",16-04-24,Remarks as Prepared for John Podesta Columbia Global Energy Summit,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/04/16/remarks-as-prepared-for-john-podesta-columbia-global-energy-summit/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If Congress enacted President Biden’s tax plan, tens of millions of workers and families would have their taxes cut, nobody making less than $400,000 would pay a penny more in taxes, and the wealthy and big corporations would finally pay their fair share—which would fully pay for the President’s tax cuts and investment agenda.,In sharp contrast, the Republican Study Committee—which represents 80% of House Republicans and 100% of their leadership—just released an extreme budget that sides with the wealthy and large corporations, with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the richest Americans, doubling down on the failed approach of the Trump tax cuts. If their extreme proposals became law, millions of families would face higher taxes and higher costs, and receive worse customer service from the IRS. Meanwhile, billionaires and the biggest corporations would get huge tax cuts and get away with cheating on their taxes. House Republicans would help billionaires while hurting families by cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and other programs hardworking Americans count on.,President Biden Would Make the Wealthy and Big Corporations Pay Their Fair Share, While Cutting Taxes for Working Families and the Middle Class,The President’s plan would build on his progress to date, including proposals to:,House Republicans Would Slash Taxes for the Wealthy and Big Corporations, Raise Taxes on Millions of Americans, and Cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,The extreme Republican budget proposes $5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations, including:,While cutting taxes for billionaires, the extreme Republican budget would make devastating cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and other programs hardworking Americans count on, and raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, including:,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",15-04-24,"FACT SHEET: This Tax Day, the Tax Contrast Couldn’t Be Clearer",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/15/fact-sheet-this-tax-day-the-tax-contrast-couldnt-be-clearer/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Scranton Cultural Center,Scranton, Pennsylvania,2:29 P.M. EDT,THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Scranton.  (Applause.),Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.),AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  I think I should go home now, except I’m already home.,Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  Please, take a seat if you have one.,Amy, thank you for that introduction and for your work as an educator.  You know, it was great to meet your family, including your husband, Michael, whose uncle Jimmy McNulty was the former mayor and grew up with me in Scranton, Pennsylvania.,You know, thanks to the mayor, Paige C- — C- — excuse me, I’m going to — I was going to talk about the old mayor — Paige Cognetti, for that welcome.  And she’s been incredible.  She’s been with me all along the way.,It’s always great to be with one of America’s best governors, and I mean this sincerely: Josh Shapiro.  (Applause.)  He’s the best.  Stand up, Josh.  Get up.,I think — I think Josh and a lot of people are always tired of hearing me talk about Scranton, but it — but, you know, Scranton is a place that climbs into your heart and it never leaves.  I mean that sincerely.  It’s home, that’s a special thing that’s etched into your heart.,For me, it was 2446 North Washington Avenue, just a block away from Amy’s house.  (Laughter.),We used to come back after morning mass at St. Paul’s on Sunday — St. Clare’s wasn’t built until I had moved — and my grandfather, who worked for the newspaper, and my uncles would hold court around a kitchen table with a guy who was sort of the — the David Broder of the — of the Pennsylvania pr- — Scranton press.  You think I’m kidding.  It wasn’t, but anyway.  And he would — they’d — they’d come and have breakfast at the table.  And a kid could wander around the table where the adults were sitting, but you could — but you could never sit at the table.,And I’d walk up and stand next to my grandpop and — while he was — while they were having conversation, and they were talking about what — they’d talk about what was going on in the neighborhood.  They’d talk about what was going on in the world.  They were all learned men.  And — and I learned a lot here in Scranton.,I learned that money doesn’t determine your worth.  My grandfather would tell me, “Joey, nobody — nobody is more worthy than you, and everyone is your equal.”  And that was a —,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yes.,THE PRESIDENT:  No, that was — (applause) —,I learned that no one’s looking for a handout.  All anybody wants is a fair shot — a fair shot at making it, and they deserve a fair shot.,My dad had a saying.  He’d say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect.  It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.”,You know, people like Donald Trump learned very different lessons.  He learned the best way to get rich is inherit it.  (Laughter.)  Not a bad way.  I’m not —,He learned that paying taxes was something people who worked for a living did, not him.,He learned that telling people “you’re fired” was something to laugh about.,I guess that’s how you look at the world when you’re in Park Avenue and Mar-a-Lago.  But if you grew up in a place like Scranton, nobody handed you anything.  You paid your taxes.  You made sure being told “you’re fired” wasn’t entertainment; it was a nightmare that people worried about.,And all people knew — all I knew about the people like Trump who looked down on us were the people that haven’t changed.  They wouldn’t welcome us in their homes and their clubs.,Folks, where we come from matters.,When I look at the economy, I don’t see it through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago.  I see it through the eyes of Scranton — and that’s not hyperbole; that’s a fact — where honesty and decency matter, where faith matters, where family is everything, where we grew up knowing in our homes that Wall Street didn’t build this country.  The middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class.  (Applause.),We know the best way to build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.  Because when you do that, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does well, and the wealthy still do very well.  We all do well.,That’s a stark contrast from my opponent.  He looks at the economy from Mar-a-Lago, where he and his rich friends embrace the failed trickle-down policies that have failed working families for more than 40 years.,Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values: These are the competing visions for our economy, and they raise questions of fundamental fairness at the heart of this campaign that I want to talk to you about a little bit today.,Folks, does anybody really think that the present tax code is fair?  Raise your hand if you think it’s fair.  I’m not joking.  Well, neither do I.  (Laughter.),I’m a capitalist.  If you want to — if you’re able to go out and make a million bucks, fine.  That’s okay.  But just make sure you pay your fair share in taxes.  (Applause.),A fair tax code is how we invest in the things that make this country strong: healthcare, education, defense, and so much more.,But here’s the deal.  For more than 40 years, our Republican friends have promised that the best way to grow the economy is from the top down.  But here’s what they don’t tell you: It’s never worked.  The benefits don’t trickle down.,When the very wealthy pay less in taxes, then we have to borrow more and invest less in the things that families really need, from schools, to hospitals, healthcare, roads, bridges, and so much more.,Think what’s happens when that factory closes in Scranton or anywhere around the country, when the school is underfunded, when inequity grows larger and larger. It puts the middle class further in th- — out of reach and rips the dignity and pride and hope out of communities all across the country, including right here in Pennsylvania.,Folks, trickle-down economics failed the middle class.  It failed America.  And the truth is, Donald Trump embodies that failure.  He wants to double down on trickle down.,His failure starts with his $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefitted the wealthiest and biggest corporations and exploded the federal debt when he was president.  Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any President of the United States in a term in all of American history — more to the national debt.,Meanwhile, when the pandemic hit, Trump failed the most basic duty any president owes the American people: a duty to care and a duty to respond.  Remember when he told us, “Don’t worry; this will all be over by Easter”?  Remember when he told us, literally, inject bleach?  (Laughter.),Bless me, Father.  (The President makes the sign of the cross.)  (Laughter and applause.),Look, think about it.  Think about it.  Because he failed to care, not only did people die, but millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their livelihoods.  On Trump watch — on,Trump is,[Trump’s] watch, for the four years he was president, we lost — nearly 3 million jobs were lost.  275,000 of those jobs lost right here in Pennsylvania.  In the Scranton area, Trump lost 17,400 jobs.  180,000 manufacturing jobs lost nationwide, including 37,000 manufacturing jobs right here in Pennsylvania.,There are only two presidents on record in all of American history that left office with fewer jobs than when they entered office: Herbert Hoover and, yes, Donald “Herbert Hoover” Trump.  (Laughter and applause.),Look, Trump is running again on the same trickle-down — failed trickle-down policies.  Nothing has changed.,Just a few months ago, at a closed-door event in Mar-a-Lago, he told his millionaire and billionaire donors the following — this is a quote — “You’re rich as hell, and we’re going to give you tax cuts,” end of quote.  And then they all laughed about it, not because they didn’t think it would happen, because they knew it will happen if he’s elected.,How does that make me feel?  How does it make you feel?  How does it make the people I grew up with feel?  I think it’s outrageous.,Trump wants to renew another round of billionaire tax breaks and corporate giveaways.  And, look, I come from the corporate state of the world: Delaware.  I represented it for 36 years.  They’re entitled to make a fair profit.  It makes sense.  There is more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other state in the nation combined.  But this is ridiculous, what’s going on now.,You know, there are about 1,000 billionaires — billionaires in America.  Do you know what the average federal tax rate for a billionaire is today in America?  For real: 8.3 percent.  (Laughter.)  That’s how much federal ta- — no, I’m serious.  Not a joke.  Far less than the vast majority of Americans pay in federal taxes.,No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a nurse, a sanitation worker.  (Applause.)  I mean it.,And that tax break that he passed several years ago is about to expire.  But Trump wants to give another billionaire tax break.,Listen to what he says.  Trump says his MAGA friends want to, quote, “terminate” — I love his terminology — “terminate” the Affordable Care Act.  That would mean over 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions who now have healthcare because of the Affordable Care Act would lose their coverage.  One hundred million.  It means millions of young people would be kicked off their parents’ healthcare policies once they turn 26.,The Affordable Care Act is paid for by a surtax on the very wealthy investment income.  Trump wants to get rid of that, and as a consequence, would cost millions of American who lose coverage an average of an additional $6,000 a year to maintain their healthcare.  It would mean billionaires would get, as a consequence of not having to pay the tax anymore, another $3.5 million tax cut per billionaire.,You heard me right.  Billionaires would each get an additional tax cut every year of $3.5 million.  That’s 70 times what a typical family here in Scranton makes in one year.,I have a better idea.  As soon as I came into office, I expanded tax credits through the Affordable Care Act and saved millions of Americans another $800 per person per year on their healthcare premiums.  (Applause.),Healthcare should be a basic right.  Those tax credits are going to expire next year though.  And I want to make those tax credits permanent.  It’s the first thing I’ll do if I’m reelected is make them permanent.  (Applause.),Folks, and my plan calls for a minimum federal income tax of 25 percent — just 25 percent on billionaires.  Well below the top rate, but fair, and they can afford it.  Do you know how much money that would raise?  That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years.  Five hundred billion dollars.  (Applause.)  It would be a drop in the bucket for them.  They wouldn’t have to sell one single bit of their assets.,And imagine what we could do for America.  Imagine a future with affordable childcare, paid leave,,homecare, eldercare, and more, like every major country in the world has.  Of all this is not only good for families.  It creates jobs.  It generates growth.  It generates income.  It generates economic vitality.,Because guess what?  When you have childcare and you don’t have to go out and hire somebody, you can go to work.  It ge- — I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: What would — what would — what’s the effect of this?  The effects of what I’m talking about is increase — increase economic growth.,We have the most successful economy in the world today.,But, folks, how does Trump pay for these billionaire tax cuts?  Well, Trump recently said Social Security and Medicare, quote — here’s his quote: “There’s a lot you can do in terms of cutting,” end of quote.,Well, right on cue, the MAGA Republicans in Congress released their budget, which hasn’t gotten nearly enough attention.  The budget they proposed for next year would raise the retirement age of Social Security and would slash Medicare.,Think about that for a second.  MAGA Republicans want billionaires to pay less in taxes, want seniors to work longer before they can retire on Social Security benefits, and they want to cut Medicare.,I got a better idea.  Let’s protect Social Security and Medicare and make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share — (applause) — in high taxes.,And, by the way, whether you’re liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, or independent — whatever you are, think about it.  We’re not asking much.  Just asking for just basic fairness.,You know, I’ve already been delivering real results in a fiscally responsible way.  But I know not everyone is feeling it.,Just the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help.  He was drowning in debt.  I said, “I’m sorry, Donald, but I can’t help you.”  (Laughter and applause.)  Nothing I can do.  (Applause.),Look, on a serious note, since I came to office — (laughter) — I’ve already cut the federal deficit.  You know, all the stuff they talk about what we’ve done — and I’m going to be self-serving a little bit: Every other — every objective alternative points out we’ve had the most successful economy of any major economy in the world so far.  A lot more to do, but guess what?  During the whole time, I’ve been able to cut the federal deficit at the same exact time by over $1 trillion — $1 trillion.  (Applause.),And I signed a bipartisan budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade as well.  And I know what to cut.  (Applause.)  I want to cut the federal deficit even more by making big corporations and the very wealthy begin to finally pay their fair share.  We’re not asking anything that’s unusual.,Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny.  I hope you’re all able to make $400,000.  (Laughter.)  I never did.  But they’re not going to pay an extra penny in federal taxes.  That’s a promise.  Nobody.  Not one penny.,You know, I have to say: If Trump’s stock in the Truth Social — his — his company — drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his.  (Laughter and applause.)  It’s possible.,Folks, look, I want to cut taxes on hardworking folks here in Scranton and all across the country, in Claymont — where I moved from Scranton to Claymont, in Delaware — all across the country, like Amy’s family.,In fact, the Child Tax Credit I extended during the pandemic put up to $300 per child — per child [a month] in the pockets of around 40 million working families, and it literally cut child poverty in half.  And we still reduced the deficit.  (Applause.)  We still reduced the deficit.  That included helping 1.4 million families and nearly 2.4 million children right here in Pennsylvania.,Republicans refused to extend it, which raised taxes on working families.  I want to restore it — restore the expanded Child Care Tax Credit, because no child should live in poverty in this country — no child.  (Applause.),We’ve got a lot more work to do.  I know the cost of housing is so important.  I want to provide families like Amy’s a $10,000 tax credit to help them buy their first home or trade up for a little more space.,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you.,THE PRESIDENT:  Well, no, it’s important.  And, by the way, it will grow the economy.,When Trump was president in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 made $40 billion in profit and paid zero — zero in federal income taxes.,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Sinful.  Sinful.,THE PRESIDENT:  Well, guess what?  I came along and took care of the sin.  (Applause.)  Not anymore.,Thanks to the law that I wrote and signed, big corporations now have to pay a minimum — they should be paying more — a minimum of 15 percent tax.  It was a start but not enough.,By doing that 15 percent tax, they pay for every program that people are now benefitting from and still cut the deficit by $70 billion.  (Applause.),And, by the way, that 15 percent is still less than working people play in federal tax- — pay in federal taxes.  It’s time to raise the corporate tax — minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally has to pay their fair share.,But, you know, Trump and his MAGA friends want to get rid of the corporate minimum tax.,With the same law, I gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drugs, which is why those of you have diabetes and need insulin, instead of paying 400 bucks a month, you’re now paying $35 a month for insulin.  (Applause.),I’ve been working on taking on Big Pharma my whole career.  But guess what?  If I put you on Air Force One, we flew out of here, and you went — you name — you took a prescription you had from a drug company in America, I will take you to any city you name, whether it’s Berlin, whether it’s in Canada, whether it’s in Hungary.  Wherever it is.  And you’ll pay 40, 60 percent less for that same exact prescription.  Not a joke.,And, by the way, when we in fact reduce some — there’s much more to come in that healthcare proposal — that Medicare proposal.,For example, seniors, beginning in,2024,[2025], no matter how much their prescription drug costs are, they’ll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what.  (Applause.),And, by the way, companies will still make money.  They’ll still make a significant profit — still make a significant profit.  It helps reduce the — and, by the way, when we do this, it has a benefit, and that’s already part of the law I passed.  But guess what?  Not only does it reduce the federal deficit — help with the prescription holder, it reduces the federal debt.,You know how much the first tranche of this has done?  It’s reduced the federal debt by $160 billion.  (Applause.)  Why?  Because Social Security — Medicare does not have to pay out $400 a month.  They’re paying out $35 a month.  (Applause.),But Trump has committed, if he’s reelected, from — gets elected again, he wants to get rid of the law and give Big Pharma the power again to charge again whatever you want, which will also increase the deficit.,Folks, are we going to let that happen?,AUDIENCE:  Nooo —,THE PRESIDENT:  We can’t.,And that same law empowers the IRS to go after the super wealthy.  You know, what — you ever — it’s amazing how the — we had passed legislation increasing the number of auditors.  Guess who wanted them all cut?  No, I’m not joking.  Republicans.,Why?  Because it takes an awful lot of sophistication to be able to go through the tax returns of these billionaires to know what’s going on.,But while you work hard and pay your taxes, Trump wants to give his billionaire friends the power to avoid paying even what they already owe, not what they should be paying.,I know you — if you didn’t know better, you’d think I’m making this up, but you can check it all out.,Folks, he’s coming for your money, your healthcare, and your Social Security.  And we’re not going to let it happen.  (Applause.)  We’re not going to — can’t let it happen.,Look, let me close with this.  As you obne- — observed — I can’t hide it, Scranton fills me with enormous pride.  My mom didn’t live in Scranton permanently since 1954.  I swear to God, whenever she was asked, no matter where we were, “Mrs. Biden, where do you live?  Where are you from?”  She’d say, “Scranton.”  (Laughter.),Do you know anybody who’s from Scranton that still doesn’t brag about being from Scranton?  (Laughter.),Look, because I see here what I saw in Claymont, Delaware, where we moved — it used to be a big steel town with 4,000 workers — all gone now.  Although, we’re back for — with other growth.  In Claymont, Delaware, and what I see in so many towns around America: a deep pride — a deep, deep pride in your work, a deep pride in your family, a deep pride in your community and in your country.,I’ve always thought the World War Two monument downtown by City Hall says so much about Scranton.  My Uncle Ambrose Finnegan — Bosie Finnegan from North Washington — he served and died in World War Two.  Right after D-Day, on Sunday, all four of my mother’s brothers signed up to go fight in the military.  In those days, you could do it — brothers could go off to war together.  Fathers and brothers could do the same.,And that war — I — and everybody called him Bosie Finnegan.  Bosie was a hell of an athlete, but Bosie joined the Army Air Corps before there was an Air Force.  And his name is etched on the monument down by City Hall.  Here in Scranton, I grew up understanding we have many obligations as a country, but we only have — and I got in trouble for saying this from the time I was a young senator.  We only — we have many obli- — we have only one truly sacred obligation,,and that is to equip those we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home or if they don’t come home. (Applause.),I don’t want to lose my temper on this.  But I think about that statue in town now that I’m Commander-in-Chief.  And I had them double-check if my memory was correct that Uncle Bosie, Ambrose J. Finnegan’s name is etched on that statue.,I have to say, there are a lot of things that Donald Trump has said and done that I find extremely offensive.  But one that offends me the most is when he refused, as president, to visit an American cemetery outside of Paris when he was president.  Why?  He said that those soldiers who gave their lives were, quote — it was his quote — “suckers” and “losers.”  “Suckers” and “losers,” he said it.,Who the hell does he think he is?  Who does he think he is?  These were heroes.  (Applause.),These soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served this nation.  (Applause.)  Believing otherwise, that alone is disqualifying for someone to seek this office.  Thank God I wasn’t standing next to him.  (Applause.),But as I’ve said, Donald Trump looks at the world differently than you and me.  He wakes up in the morning in Mar-a-Lago thinking about himself, how he can help his billionaire friends gain power and control and force their extreme agenda on the rest of us.,Listen to what he says.  He says, quote, “I’ll be dictator on day one.”  Quote, “I am your retribution.”  He promises, quote, “a bloodbath” if he loses.  This guy denies January 6th.  Listen — listen to what he says, because you know he means it.,I wake every morning thinking about how to make life better, like you do, for working- and middle-class families here in Scranton and all across the country, where the power and the freedom rest with you and “We the People.”,Maybe that’s why millions of everyday power- — folks are powering our campaign.  So far, 1.6 million people have contributed to our campaign, with 550,000 brand new this time around.  (Applause.)  And they’re new contributors.  But guess what?  97 percent of these contributions were under $200.  It matters.  You matter.,My grandfather would tell me when I walked out the door in North Scran- — in North — North Scra- — in North Washington Avenue in Scranton, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith,” when I was a kid.  And my grandmother would yell, “No, Joey, spread it.  Spread it.”  (Applause.),Let’s keep the faith.  Let’s spread it.  Let’s remember who we are.  We are the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There is nothing — nothing beyond our capacity than when we act together.,God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  (Applause.),Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, folks.  (Applause.),Thank you.,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.,2:58 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,12:55 P.M. EDT,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just have one thing at the top, and then I’ll turn it over to the Admiral.,Starting today, the President will kick off his three-day swing through Pennsylvania.  As you know, we’re on our way to his hometown of Scranton, where he will deliver remarks at a campaign event.  I’ll refer you to the campaign for more details on the event.,Tomorrow, the President will travel to Pittsburgh, where he will participate in two campaign events.  I’ll refer you to the campaign for more details.,President Biden is investing in Pennsylvania, and it’s working.  The unemployment rate in the state is near a record low of 3.4 percent, down from 7.4 percent when he took office.,Four hundred and eighty thousand applications have been filed to start new businesses.  That’s up 36 percent.,He invested $16 billion in roads, bridges, public transit, replacing lead pipes, and other infrastructure.,Thanks to the President — to the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, 2.9 million seniors are saving money on Medicare from the 35 bucks cap of insulin to free vaccines to lower drug prices.  And 420,000 Pennsylvanians have health insurance — health — health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.,On Thursday, the President will travel to Philadelphia for campaign events, as I mentioned.  The President will remain focused on the historic economic progress from the last three years.  And this week, you’ll hear directly from him in stops across the state on how his administration is doing exactly that.,With that, as you can see, the Admiral is here to take any questions you may have on the Middle East and anything else.,Go ahead.,MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Karine.  I can just go right into questions.,Q    As Israel — as Israel considers whether to attack Iran, what advice has the U.S. given the Israelis?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, again, these are going to be Israeli decisions to make and for them to speak to one way or the other.,In the President’s call with the Prime Minister on Saturday night, he lauded the commendable effort to successfully knock down the vast, vast majority of missiles and drones that Iran threw at them.  And — and, again, our view was it was an incredible success, and that success alone sends a lot of strong messages to Iran and to our partners in the region, as well as to Israel, about how strong they are and how — how utterly Iran failed.,The President does not want to see — and he said this before: He does not want to see a war with Iran.  Don’t want to see the conflict widen or deepen.,Q    John, yesterday, I believe you said that you would — that the President would not support a standalone bill.  We see that Speaker Johnson is suggesting four standalone bills, I believe.  Would you all be opposed to a series of standalone bills?,MR. KIRBY:  We — we do not — we don’t support a standalone bill that only funds Israel, because Ukraine needs munitions too.,Now, look, I think we still have to see the Speaker’s proposal in more detail.  The important thing is that the House moves this week to help us get security assistance for Israel, Ukraine, and also for the Indo-Pacific.  They need to move this week.,And as for the details, we’ll wait and see what the Speaker comes up with.,Q    So, you’re okay with four bills?,MR. KIRBY:  Again, we’re going to wait and pass judgment after we’ve had a chance to take a look closer at the Speaker’s proposal.,The important thing is that our allies, like Ukraine and Israel, who are under the gun — literally, under the gun — get the security assistance they need as quickly as possible.  So, we want them to move this week.,Q    And, right now, you’re not sure of the details of the bills — if they’re something the White House can support at this point?,MR. KIRBY:  I think we just need to see more right now than we do — I think we need to see more than we have right now to be able to — it does appear, at first blush, that the Speaker’s proposals will, in fact, help us get aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel, and needed resources to the Indo-Pacific for a wide range of contingency — contingencies there.  At first blush, it looks like that.  We just want to get more detail.,Q    So, whether it’s all together or separate is not a deal-breaker per se?,MR. KIRBY:  Again, at first blush, it looks like the Speaker’s proposal does cover those immediate needs, and they are immediate needs, but we’re waiting to get a little bit more detail before we — we say one way or the other.,Q    John, the Speaker said that it would include loans to Ukraine and other, I think, accountability measures that the White House before has said that, you know, would complicate the — the distribution of aid.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, yeah.,Q    Have you had a chance to evaluate those at all?  And — and can you talk about what the President said to the Speaker in their phone conversation yesterday?,MR. KIRBY:  Same answer as I gave before.  I think, again, it appears at first blush that these proposals do get the necessary security assistance to Ukraine and Israel at a critical time right now.  We want to learn a little bit more.,I won’t go into more detail about the conversation with the Speaker.  I think Karine has already talked to you guys about that.  And I’ll leave it at that.,Except that — the only thing I would say is that the President stressed very strongly that we’ve got to move this national security supplemental funding as quickly as possible.  We need to see the House move this week.,Q    And I know —,Q    Is — is the President watching or being briefed on former President Trump’s trial in Manhattan?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President is going to Pennsylvania today, and he’s going to do a three-stop tour.  He’s going to focus on how he’s continuing to help the American people.  And you’ll hear directly from him today.  That’s his focus.  His focus is on the American people.,I don’t have anything else.,Q    It’s been 11 days since the World Central Kitchen’s — the investigation into the World Central Kitchen strike was released.  Why is the U.S. review of that report taking so long?,MR. KIRBY:  We’re — we’re still taking a look at that.  I don’t think we’ve — haven’t come to any conclusions one way or another about it.  I think you can expect we want to — want to do this in a thoughtful way.,Q    I heard what you said earlier that, you know, Israel’s response will be its own.  But has Israel told the U.S. what it’s planning to do at this point?,MR. KIRBY:  I will refer you to the Israelis to speak to their decision-making process.  That’s really for them to speak to, not us.,Q    Going back to Ukraine for a second, John.  What’s the situation on the ground?  How under stress is the Ukrainian military?,MR. KIRBY:  It’s incredible the — the stress that they’re under, particularly in the Donbas area where the Russians continue to push west out of Avdiivka.  They keep making — it’s not a lot of progress every day, but it’s a little bit of progress every day.  They’re pushing back against the deeper defensive lines of the Ukrainians.,And it’s not just in the east.  There is some movement down in the south as well.  But just as critically, the se- — you know, Saturday night when we were watching 300 missiles and drones getting launched from Iran into Israeli, Mr. Putin was still firing those same Iranian drones and missiles into Ukraine at various sites, knocking out their energy infrastructure, going after the defense industrial base.,So, it’s a very active scene in Ukraine and the need is acute there as well, which is why we said earlier we wouldn’t support a standalone Israel bill that — because it wouldn’t account for what Ukraine needs.,Now, again, the Speaker has put forward a proposal that would factor in Ukraine, so we’ll have to see what that looks like.,Q    Yesterday, Ukraine’s president gave an interview to PBS News in which he wondered why, essentially, allies could not shoot down missiles over Ukraine — similar he gave the example to Iran — and he raised that in the interview.,MR. KIRBY:  And I mentioned this yesterday, I think.  I mean, it’s a different fight altogether.  The President has been very clear that there won’t be U.S. boots on the ground.  The United States will not get involved in a combat role in the war in Ukraine.  It’s a different fight.  It’s a different —,Q    (Inaudible.),MR. KIRBY:  It’s a different — we — we have long said we’re not going to be involved in a combat role in Ukraine.  The President has been very — very, very consistent on that.,Q    Is it different just because Russia has nukes?,MR. KIRBY:  It’s — we’ve been very consistent on that.  It’s a different fight altogether, a different set of circumstances.,Q    Because of the nuclear issue or because of like, different —,MR. KIRBY:  Different set of circumstances.,Q    Any update on the Rafah meeting?,MR. KIRBY:  No update on the meeting to speak to today, Steve.  We’re still hoping to have another round.,I will add that after the virtual meeting, there were — I’m sorry — there were technical talks at a lower level on the staff.  Those talks continued between the Israelis and the United States.  And we’re hoping to get another meeting on — for Rafah here in coming days.  But I don’t have anything on the schedule.,Q    Has there been any communications with Iran since the attack that happened over the weekend —,MR. KIRBY:  Not that I’m aware of.,Q    — through the — through those indirect channels?,MR. KIRBY:  Not that I’m aware of.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay?,Q    What was the — oh, sorry.  Last thing.  What was the President’s reaction to the protests about Gaza yesterday that shut down major thoroughfares in big cities?,MR. KIRBY:  I haven’t had a chance to speak to the President about his personal reaction to — to that.  You know, and I think Karine has already talked very much about the protest activity.  And I’ll — I’ll leave it to her.,Thank you.,Q    Karine, will the President talk about the U.S. Steel-Nippon merger at all when he’s in Pennsylvania?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I don’t have anything to share about that.  But obviously, the President’s commitment to steel workers continues and stand.  He’s a union guy.  But I don’t have anything to share about tomorrow’s event.,We’ll certainly have more later today.  We’ll have a press call.  So, I would urge you and your colleagues to certainly join the press call later today.,Q    Do you know when the last time was the President spent the night in his hometown?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The last time he’s been to Scranton?,Q    For the night.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The night?  Oh, that’s a good question.  I do not know.  I can find out for you.,Q    To what extent is this sort of a homecoming for him going back to his hometown?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think you’ll hear directly from the President.  This is going to be — this is a homecoming for sure.  I had an opportunity to talk to him about it this morning.,Going back to Scranton is always — it always feels good to go see where he spent a lot of his childhood.  And so, you all will be able to see that directly.,I got to be careful because it is a — that portion is a campaign portion.  So, I would — we’ll certainly refer you to the campaign.  But it al- — always feels good to be back in S- — Pennsylvania.  Always feels good to be back to Scranton for this President.,Q    Inflation has been a stubborn concern for a lot of Americans.  You know, do — does the President think that his tax plans will, you know, help alleviate some of those concerns by, you know, pulling more taxes from the — from the wealthy?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the President’s tax cuts for working families and the middle class are fully paid for by making billionaires and big corporation pay for their share — fair share.  His tax plan would lower costs for families with lower taxes, lower healthcare costs, and lower utility bills.  That’s the President’s focus.,And unfortunately, what we’re seeing from congressional Republicans, they want to give big tax breaks for mil- — billionaires and — and corporations.  They see a total opposite way of giving Americans breathing room.  They are not doing that, and we’re trying to do that.,Q    So, I guess what I’m trying to say is: Americans are concerned about inflation.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    The President wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations.  How is that addressing their concerns about the economy?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think our focus when it comes to the economy — we say this all the time — is building an economy from the bottom up, middle out and making sure that we’re continuing to lower costs.  That’s the thing — right? — that is the thing that Americans care about when we talk about the economy: How do we lower costs?,And this is something that the President has continued to do over the last three years — right? — whether it’s healthcare from — you know, beating Big Pharma; whether it’s doing everything that we can to lower the cost at the pump — at the gas pumps because of Ukraine, because of COVID.  And so, he’s going to stay really focused on that.  You hear us talk about junk fees.  And so, look, that’s going to be his focus, is continuing to do that.,I do want to say, I think we had confirmed that the President spoke to Speaker Johnson, and Speaker Johnson shared the plan with him.  Obviously, we’re going to look at the details of — of that plan.  But you heard from the Admiral, you heard from National Security Council, you heard from the President over the weekend how important it is to move forward with that — that — for getting aid to Ukraine and, obviously —,Q    Was it accurate that — was it accurate that Speaker Johnson initiated the call?  I believe he told Fox News he called the President.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes, I can confirm that.  I just don’t want to go into details of the — of the call.  And the Speaker did share the plan with the President.,Q    Splitting it in four pieces seems kind of risky, right?  I mean —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, want to be super mindful.  We’re going to see the details of — of what he is planning.  But we’ve been really clear: We want to see all of the parts that the President has talked about, getting that really important funding for Ukraine, Israel, Indo-Pacific, obviously that humanitarian aid that’s needed right now — dire situation in Gaza, as we talked about.  We do not want to see a standalone.  We want to see all of these components move forward.,But we want to be super mindful here.  We’re going to see the details — what’s — what’s in writing — the details of the — of the plan.  But, obviously, we want to see what — what the Speaker has to share.,Q    Karine, a — a second Republican — House Republican endorsed the motion to vacate against Speaker Johnson over the Ukraine funding.  If the Speaker does push forward with this, you know, effort to get the Ukraine aid, would the President recommend Democrats come to his aid if there’s a challenge to his leadership?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, again, as you know, Justin, I get this question often, and — and we’ve been very consistent.  We don’t get involved when it comes to congressional leadership, how they choose their leadership.  That is something for Congress to decide on.,And, obviously, you know, Leader — Leader Jeffries, who is the Democratic Leader in the House, that’s something for he and his caucus to — to decide.  I just don’t want to get involved — we’ve been very — or speak to it.  We’ve been very, very clear about that.,I think we’re going to have to sit.  All right?,Q    Okay.,Q    Thanks, Karine.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks guys.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  Thank you so much.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You’re very welcome.,1:07 P.M.

The pandemic profoundly affected every individual, community and country, causing millions of deaths, significant societal disruptions, and trillions of dollars in economic losses globally.  Since day one, the President has directed his Administration to protect the American people from future health threats, recognizing that a biological threat anywhere can turn into a health emergency everywhere. Over the past three years, the Biden-Harris Administration has actively advanced a bold agenda to achieve the vision of a world free from pandemics and other health security threats. While the United States has made notable progress over the past three years, there is more work ahead.,THE NEW GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY STRATEGY,The new Global Health Security Strategy articulates a whole-of-government, science-based approach to strengthening global health security.,Building on progress achieved since 2019 and incorporating lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global Health Security Strategy lays out a path to deliver on the goals in the,2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan,and the bipartisan Global Health Security and International Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response Act of 2022, which was enacted as part of the,James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023,. ­It places county-driven action, equity, and inclusion at its core to ensure the world is better prepared to prevent and respond to health emergencies, including pandemics. The Strategy also envisions using United States leadership to drive global action toward shared goals, including stronger investment and commitment by other countries.,The 2024 U.S. Global Health Security Strategy sets out three goals to guide the United States’ affirmative agenda to advance global health security:,These will further accelerate country implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and contribute towards achieving the G7 Pact for Pandemic Readiness Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) targets.,The United States will also continue to deliver on the commitment to transform financing for global health security.  The COVID-19 response highlighted limitations in the GHS financing ecosystem.  In a health emergency, countries need to be able to quickly access financing to fortify their health systems, procure medical countermeasures, and launch an effective response.  The United States is the world’s leading investor in health security, and it is a top priority of the United States to collaborate with countries, regional and multilateral partners, including public and private sector organizations, to identify and strengthen solutions to enhance access to financing for pandemic preparedness and response.  To overcome the cycle of crisis and complacency in investing in health security capacity, the United States led the way to establish the historic,Pandemic Fund,in 2022, and we are dedicated to working with all partners to ensure the Fund excels in its mission to support countries most in need.  Simultaneously, the United States continues to support efforts to transform international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, and to clarify and strengthen the pandemic preparedness and response efforts of multilateral development banks and development financing institutions to better address crises, including pandemics.,Collectively, these actions will make the United States, and the world, safer from the risk posed by pandemics and other health security events.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",16-04-24,FACT SHEET: Biden-⁠Harris Administration Releases Strategy to Strengthen Global Health Security,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/16/fact-sheet-biden-%e2%81%a0harris-administration-releases-strategy-to-strengthen-global-health-security/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

used to have an expression.  He’d say, “Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end” — “the beginning, the middle, and the end.”,(Addressing Megan Bell’s daughter, Eloise.)  And you need Secret Service guarding you.  (Laughter.),But, folks, look, first of all, I want to thank the Carpenters Union.  They’ve been with me for my entire career.  They’ve been loyal to me, and I think I’ve been loyal to them.  (Applause.),Now, one of the things that she hadn’t told you is Tommy is — along with Larry — Larry, stand up.  This is Larry Orr.  Larry is another one of the — (applause) — he lived right across the gates in Marywood — and another guy named Charlie Roth, the four of us were inseparable.,When — when things changed for my dad up in Scranton and lost his job, we moved back to Delaware, where he was from.  And when he originally — that’s where he came from — Delaware — to Scranton.,And — and I’d come home, though, for every holiday, almost all summer.  And when I fell in love when I was in law school — actually, it wasn’t even law school; I was in college.  I went on spring break.  I had made $85 of — from a tax return.  (Laughter.)  And — oh, you think I’m kidding; I’m not.  (Laughter.),And my dad didn’t own but he ran an automobile dealership.  And so, I had a car, and I put five guys in the car.  They all chipped in to pay the way down.  We went to Lauderdale.,Now, the problem is — I’m going to lose a lot of credibility with all of you — (laughter) — but I’m the only Scrantonian and the only Irishman you’ve ever met that’s never had a drink in his life because too many people have too many drinks in their life, in my opinion.  (Laughter.)  And so, we got down to Fort Lauderdale, and all everybody was doing is drunk most of the time.  And I found out that there was a possibility of being able to get on a plane for 20 bucks — $22 round trip to go to Nassau.,So, I thought, “Well, there may be some nice girls in Nassau.”  (Laughter.)  The only reason we all came down — any rate.,So, I got on the plane, and I had two guys with me.  We had just finished spring football practice at the University of Delaware.  And I had been named as the likely starting safety that year and — next year.  And so, we started off, and a guy named — his nickname was Mi- — he was Mike McCrann.  We called him “Crash” McCrann.  He looked like Rock Hudson and acted like it.  (Laughter.)  And a guy named Fred Sears, who ran one of the biggest banks in Delaware later.,And so, we walked into — we went to the British Colonial hotel.  We — actually, we found a bunch of guys from Michigan.  We slept on the floor of their place.  And — and we went to go to the beach.  Turns out, all the beaches in Nassau — public beaches, there’s none of the college girls.  They’re — you know, they — they’re all locals, and there’s not many people.,So, we walked down to the beach this particular day — the first day we got there — and the British Colonial hot- — hotel had this chain-link fence that ran from the street all the way down into the water so you couldn’t cross into the — the hotel area.  And so, we wondered what the heck we were going to do.,Turns out they — a bunch of folks going in and throwing their towels saying “British Colonial hotel” on it over the wi- — barbed wire — not barbed wire — chain-link fence.  So, I had an idea.  We each grabbed a towel, put it around us, and we walked in the front door — (laughter) — no, I’m serious; true story — of the British Colonial hotel.,And we walked in and we acted like — and you walked in, and you had the — the registration on the left and down the cent- — but straight ahead — like, from here, half again the distance from the back wall — was the glass looking out on the swimming pool and then beyond the swimming pool and onto the ocean.,And so, we just walked in like we belonged there and walked right out.  (Laughter.)  And I’m standing there, and we’re all looking around, and I saw this beautiful young woman.  I said, “I’m going to go talk to her.”  And old Crash McCrann, I nicknamed — he was a fullback — I said, “No, I am.”  I said — and Fred Sears, my buddy, flipped a coin.  I won.  (Laughter.),And so, I walked up, sat down on the end of the bench of the — and the sun was coming from — toward the water.  And it was later — and toward the water.  And I sat on the end of the chaise lounge, and I said, “My name is Joe Biden.  I’m from the University of Delaware.”  And she said, “My name is Neilia Hunter.  I’m from Syracuse.”  And I said hi, and we started to talk and just talking.  And I watched this — this yacht pull up in front.  I’m not — this is not a joke.,Well, to me, it was a yacht.  It was, like, 40, 45 feet.  (Laughter.),And I see this guy with a white hat on, white, you know, uniform — not uniform — pants and the — and the shoes and the whole deal.  And he gets in a little dingy and he rows to shore.  And I’m just — I’m talking to her like — like you’re she, and I’m looking up.  And I watch the guy pull up, and he pulls a — the dingy up onto the beach.  And he starts walking toward us.,And I’m just watching him.  And he walks straight to us, and he looks down at Neilia, and he says, “Neilia, are we on for dinner tonight?”  (Laughter.),I thought, “Oh, man.”  (Laughter.),But what happened was he — she looked and she said, “Oh, I’m sorry” — it — it was the Wickwire family, a major highway contractor in New York — in Skaneateles, New York, in the state of New York.  And what — they were neighbors.,And she said, “No.”  She said, “I — Joe and I are going to go to dinner.”  (Laughter.),And so, with that, he left, and she was mortified.  She said, “I’m so sorry, but I didn’t want to.”  I said, “Why don’t we?”  I had a total of $42 left.  (Laughter.)  But then, you could buy a McDonald’s hamburger for 19 cents or something.  (Laughter.),So, she said, “Well, I kn- — I know a place we can go.”  And she’s a very classy lady.  She picked a place she thought we co- — I could afford.  And so, we walked into this particular restaurant and sat down.  I ordered a hamburger because I didn’t have any money, and she — the classy woman she was, she ordered the same thing, like whatever it was.,But anyway, we — and I was smitten by her.  I really was.  And, you know, sometimes there’s love at first sight.  This really was.  I was — my — I was just taken by her.  And she was really quiet, and she was lovely.,And one thing led to another, and she said — the bill came.  And the bill was $48.  (Laughter.)  And I had $23.  And I could feel under the table — I could feel this.  (The President rests his hand on an audience member’s knee.),And I put my hand down, and she put 40 bucks in my hand.  (Laughter.)  Her father was fairly wealthy.  He was a Navy cook and an Auburn — if you know Auburn, New York, he had a large diner in Auburn, which was very profitable, and he — he also had the contracts to do Syracuse University.,Anyway, he was a — a fairly wealthy guy.  And so, I took it, and I paid.  I said, “I’m so embarrassed.”  She said, “Oh, it happens to my father all the time.”  (Laughter.),So, we’re walking back to the hotel she was staying at, and — and I swear to God, I hadn’t kissed her, I hadn’t done — we hadn’t done a single thing together.  And there was a chain and — that w- — post and chain divid- — stopping the parking lot from coming out of the — and so, like a horse’s tail, I was going to show — I jumped over the chain.  (Laughter.)  And I caught my ankle and fell.  (Laughter.)  Totally mortified.,She said, “Oh, that’s okay.  That’s — are you okay?”  I said, “Yes.”  And I got up, and I looked at her, and I know — and this wasn’t a joke — I looked at her.  I said, “You know, I think I’m going to marry you.”  I give you my word.  (Applause.),And she looked at me, and we hadn’t even kissed one another, and she said, “I think so.”,From that time on, I quit the football team that year — that was spring practice — the next year, and I started commuting every single weekend.,My dad ran an automobile agency, and I made money by getting — there was a place called Manheim Auto Auction, where they — and I would drive to Manheim.  And back in those days in Delaware, you could not — you could not have a car on campus.  And so, a lot of the guys I was with, they were happy to get a chance to drive a relatively new car.  They paid $10 for every car we delivered back to Delaware.,So, I’d get a van, take 10 guys up, get 100 bucks; I’d keep $50.  (Laughter.)  No.  And that’s how I’d go back and forth every single weekend — every single weekend.,And — but sometimes it just happens.  Sometimes it just happens.,And — and so, no man deserves one great love, let alone two.  When she was killed in that accident with my daughter as well, my two boys weren’t expected to make it.  And they were only just three and just four years old.,And what happened was that I got put on that 10 most-eligible bachelors list in America.  (Laughter.)  You got it man.  I thought it was a pretty cool thing.  (Laughter.),But I used to send more things to the Secret Service because I’d get women sending me pictures that I was afraid I’d get set up for.  (Laughter.)  And unlike the guy running, I didn’t take advantage of any of it.  (Laughter and applause.),Any rate, to make a long story short, all kidding aside, I — I would just give them to the Secret Service.,So, I decided I couldn’t — I really couldn’t date anybody because every time I’d go out with somebody — I had more yentas in Delaware than you can imagine — very nice to me.  And so, I just gave up.,And I get a call from my youngest brother.  He said, “Joe, I’ve got just the girl for you.”  And he was at the University of Delaware at the time, as this girl was.  She used to be nine years younger than me. Now she’s 25 years younger, but — (laughter) —,So, he said, “You’ll love her.  She doesn’t like politics.”  (Laughter.)  And I met her, and this third date I went out with her, I realized I was going to marry her.,No man deserves one great love, let alone two.  So, I’ve been an incredibly fortunate guy — incredibly fortunate.,And that’s why I kept coming back up to Scranton, because what would happen is I would drive up on — after I — I paid my guys their money, I’d drive up on Friday — through Scranton, up 81, up into Syracuse, next to Skaneateles Lake — and then go back.  And I’d always stop at my Uncle Jack’s house on the way back in Scranton.,And, you know, everybody’s from Scranton, but no one ever leaves Scranton.  (Laughter.)  It’s in their — but any rate, I don’t know why the hell I told you that.  (Laughter.)  Except you reminded me.,MS. BELL:  It was my fault.  I told (inaudible).,THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, but — but, you know, look, folks, I’ve ran for — I — I can’t tell you how much I appreciate what you’ve done.  It’s a pretty basic thing for me.,You may remember when I announced for president, I said I was running for three reasons, initially.  I said, one is to restore the soul of America.  We lost a sense of decency that was in the way we campaign and what people say and how they talk to one another.,And the second thing, I said I wanted to rebuild the middle class because when the middle class works, everyone works — everyone does better.,I said, thirdly, I want to unite the country.  And I was, understandably, by the national press, viewed as I was — they’d give me credit for being a fairly significant United States senator and able to cross the aisle and get a lot done, but they thought I was extremely naive.,I don’t know how we can lead the world when we can’t unite ourselves.  I really mean it.  I mean, so, we got a lot of work to do.,And then I decided — my son Beau ended up going — volunteering to go to Iraq.  He was the attorney general of the state of Delaware.  And he came back — he — his — I was in, I think, 36, 38 times in Iraq and Afghanistan as a senator and as a vice president.  And — and he came back — he — his — his hooch — that’s where he slept — was only about 400 yards from a major burn pit.  And the burn pit is about the size of a football field — probably 80 yards long, 30, 40 yards wide — burning everything from human waste to oil and the rest.,And just like the 9/11 firemen got — my son came back after a year with glioblastoma — stage four glioblastoma.  And — and I lost him.,And I didn’t — I wasn’t going to run again.  I really wasn’t.  Not a — I give you my word, I had no intention of running again.,And then along came — along came what happened down in Charlottesville.  And I talked to the mother who lost that daughter who was killed by these — coming out of a field, in the United States of America, in the year two thousand and — I guess it was ’16, ’17, ’18, in that range, but a little later — carrying torches, Ku Klux Klan, Nazi banners — I mean, literally Nazi swastikas, and — and marching through the streets.,And my w- — my future opponent, my present opponent — they asked him what he thought of it.  He said there were “very good people on both sides.”,And I’m going to say something that may sound outrageous to you, but I thought — I thought he’s the antithesis of everything I believe, and I thought I could beat him.  And that’s why I ran.,And so, what’s at stake now, folks, is our democracy.  It’s not hyperbole.  You may remember, when I got the nomination, the first thing I did, I made a speech at the — at the — in Convention Hall — excuse me, in — in Philadelphia.  And I made a speech on democracy.,And a lot of people said, “What’s he doing that for?”  Because it is at stake.  We’ve never had this kind of a campaign before.,And so, for me, it’s not about whether or not you’re left, right, or center — although it matters to my — my philosophy of government — but it matters about whether or not you’re going to abide by the basic rules, you’re going to have a sense of decency.,You — I’ve never thought I’d see a time when I’m going through a — a neighborhood or a rural town that’s in the west and see big signs that s- — have a Trump sign in the middle that says “F Biden” and having a little kid standing with his middle finger — seven years old, eight years old.,Well, I promise, it happens all the time.  It’s not who we are.,So, the point I’m making is this.  We are — think of — think of it this way: If the United States wasn’t leading the world, who could step up to do it?  No, not a — not a joke.  What other country?  What other country?,I’ve known every major world leader for the last 35 years.  I know them all by their first names — not a joke — not because I’m important; because of the nature of my job when I was Foreign Relations Committee and a senior senator.,And, you know, the rest of the world looks to us.  I walk in a room — no matter whether it’s the G7 or the G20, whatever it is — and they all look to me — not me, Joe Biden; America — because they know we are the essential nation.  And, you know, Madeleine Albright wrote about us being the essen- — she was absolute- — absolutely right.  Absolutely right.,And we have a chance.  We have an incredible chance to change the direction of the world without using American forces.  We have enormous chance.,So, I said before I ran, I was going to write a book on inflection points in American history, where the things that happen in a very short period of time can determine what the next four, five, six decades look like.  We have a chance.  We have a chance to change the dynamic in a way that we haven’t had before.,The post-war era is over.  It’s over.  What’s going to follow?,So, I — when I started the book — and I decided to run instead.  I started the book, I talked about how technology has changed the direction in the world.  Were it not for Gutenberg inventing the print- — the printing press, there would be no unity in Europe.  They wouldn’t have been able to communicate with one another at the period of time.  All the way to the — it’s a silly example — Nixon would probably be president but for a televised debate where he perspired a great deal.,And — (laughter) — no, I — no, I’m not joking.  I’m thinking these things matter.,Even to now, look what’s happening on TikTok.  Look what’s happening.  What are the source of information?  These press people are all honest and decent, and they — they take real risks.  And not a lot — and they don’t all like me.  But they — (laughter) — no, I’m serious.  This is — they’re entitled to that.  But they take real risks.,But, folks, think about it.  Where do people get their news these days?  All the data shows hardly anybody watches the nightly news, in relative terms.  Who reads the New York Times and the — and the Wall Street Journal and the — and so on?  I mean, what percentage of people?  So, where did they get their news?  And it’s so much — so easy to just flat-out lie and not know what’s — what’s true.,So, we got a lot at stake here — a lot at stake.  But for me, it gets down to a basic thing.  My dad used to say — for real; my word — he’d say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than poli- — is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect.  It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it — and mean it.”,That’s what this is all about.  The va- — the vast majority of the American people just want an even chance — just a shot.  Just a shot.  And it breaks down into everything from taxes to philosophy.,But with your help, I’ve been able to get a lot done that no one thought could get done.  We’ve been able to get a lot done.  But there’s so much more we have to do, but we can do it.  But we have to win.,And it gets down to old-fashioned politics, gets down to knocking on doors, gets down to telling stories about why you’re for who you’re for.  It gets down to being able to have — pick these people to put yard signs up.  It matters.,Last point I’ll make — and I’m talking too long, and I apologize.  (Laughter.),The last point I’ll make is: We have over 100 — is it 120 or 160?  What’s it up to now?  Individual contributors?,AIDE:  Oh, 1.6 (inaudible).,THE PRESIDENT:  1.6 million individual contributors; 550,000 more than before then — since we started, new contributors.  You know what the — of — 97 percent of those contributors contributed less than $200 — 97 percent.,There’s a real groundswell going on because of you.  It matters.  It matters.  And people are contributing $5, $10, $30, $50.  And it’s having a real impact and real effect.,We have opened more campaign offices because of you all than he — he doesn’t — hasn’t opened any that I’m aware of.  I’m not being facetious.  I’m not being facetious.,We’re also in a situation where we’re in a position that we’re generating a paid staff.  That’s significant.  And we’re growing in every state.,I’ve been to every — every single — every single of the toss-up states so far.,And guess what?  If you knock anybody who knows anything about polling, it’s awful hard to poll these days.  Because — no, I’m serious.  But guess what?  Even in the polls that are being used now, we’re — we’re m- — we’re ahead in — in 35 polls, but — by the way — (applause) — it’s just about continuing to push.,And, again, one simple proposition: How do we give hardworking Americans an even shot, an even chance — an even chance to make it?  Just that.  Nothing more than that.  And how do we move people together again?,And I think we can do it.  I’m confident that we’re going to be able to do it.  And I feel very good about where we are because of all of you.  But thank you for what you’re doing.  Again, I — I didn’t mean to tell you so much.  (Laughter.)  But thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.),MS. FRIEDMAN:  Well, Mr. President, I think we have a few folks eager to ask you questions, if we may.,THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.,MS. FRIEDMAN:  Absolutely.  Sam.,MR. KUCHWARA:  Mr. President, what made you run for president?,THE PRESIDENT:  A simple proposition, and I was — I asked that question — I just came from my old home where I was raised in Scranton.  A simple proposition that — just simply, people just want a shot.  They just want an even shot and just to be able to realize the possibility that what they care about will matter with what will happen.,What made me run for president: In fact, when I moved from Scranton — my dad was born in Balti- — Baltimore.  They say,Baltimore,— (pronounced in an accent) — (laughter) — in Baltimore.  And his dad was with the American Oil Company.  And they opened up the — the American Oil Company, used — AMOCO, it became.  And the Blaustein family owned it.  He opened up York, Pennsylvania, then he opened up Scranton.  And they moved to Scranton when my dad was a junior in high school.,And, you know, it’s — and so, I was born in Scranton, and then we moved back to Delaware.  When we moved back to Delaware, one thing that I hadn’t seen in Scranton — there were very few African Americans in Scranton when I was here in Lackawanna County — very few.  But in Delaware, we have the eighth largest Black population as a percent of population of any state in the nation.,And in addition to that, we’re one of those border states that couldn’t — that — it was a slave state that fought on the side of the North because it couldn’t figure how to get to the South.  (Laughter.)  No, I’m serious.  So was Maryland.  So was Tennessee.  Anyway —,And so, I remember when we moved to Delaware, we lived on — in what later became Section 8 housing.  It was a long way — but very, very modest apartment complex was being built in Claymont with about 400 apartments.  And — and I remember that they’d drive — Mom would drive us up to school in the morning because it was too dangerous to — it was a — the Philadelphia Pike was an — was an access highway.  It wasn’t I-95, which is now the way to get there.  But she was worried us crossing the streets.,So, I was in third grade.  My sister was in first grade.  And they’d drop us in the parking lot.  And we used to watch — and I couldn’t understand why this little Catholic school I went to, Holy Rosary — why this bus would go by when we pulled in the parking lot that had what was referred to then as — all full of “colored” children.  There were no whites in it.  And even though the major school — public school, Claymont High School, was a right-hand turn three blocks up.,I remember asking my mother why they couldn’t come — why — why’d that bus go all the way downtown?  And she said, “Because they’re not allowed to go to school with white kids.”  “Not allowed to go to school with white kids.”,And that had an enormous impression on me.  And it got me engaged in the Civil Rights Movement.  I wasn’t in any great shape, but I was a public def- — I became a public defender after getting a job with a fancy law firm.,My city of Wilmington, Delaware, was the only city in America occupied by the military for 10 months, with the National Guard standing on the corner with drawn bayonets for 10 months when Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots that occurred.,And so, I got involved trying to change the Democratic Party and turn it into more — the conservative party on race was the Democratic Party in Delaware.  And the Republican Party, which was the party of DuPont, was very, very restrictive on economic issues, but it was more open.,So, I joined a group of senior members of the — of the Democratic Party to try to reform the Democratic Party and move it to more of a northeastern Democratic Party.  The governor of Delaware could choose to be part of the Southern Governors’ Conference or the Northeast.  And the Democrats often chose to be part of the Southern Governors’ Conference.,In the southern part of the state there is a canal that goes across the top of my state, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal that cuts u- — bisects the state.  And when you just go below that canal — and I’m not — this is not a criticism —,they talk at you like this.  Eastern Shore of Maryland.,(Pronounced in an accent.)  Very southern in the way they talk and the way they move and everything.,And so, I got involved in trying to change the party.  And one thing led to another, and I remember they came to me and said they wanted me to run — the local folks.  Trying to get people to run — just show up as Democrats in areas they — that they weren’t able to win.,And so, I got a call — I was a public defender part-time in a — and I had a law practice.  I was starting alone.,And with that, I remember a group of people from Elsmere, Delaware — the Democratic organization — came to see me, wanted me to run for the state senate.  And I said, “I can’t do that because I’m just starting a law firm, and I can’t go to Dover.”,And they came back about three days later and said, “Well, why don’t you run for the county council?”  I said, “I can’t do that.”  And they said, “Come here.”  And they walked me to my window in my office and it looked across — and they said, “They meet there twice a week at night.”  (Laughter.),So, they wanted me to run in a district no Democrat had ever run.  And I said, “Well, at least I can do my job.  I can go out and run.  Make — demonstrate that we’re running.”,And the problem is I asked my sister who has graduated with honors from Delaware, who’s smarter than me and ran my campaign.  And she won a campaign where a Democrat had never won.,And all of a sudden, I was in the county council.  And — but the Democra- — the Republicans saw something in me I didn’t see, for — it’s the God’s truth.  They saw in me that I was going to do something beyond that.,I was elected to a four-year term.  And what they did was they reapportioned me to a two-year term.  So, it was either up or out.  And I was — I was happy with that.  I was prepared to leave and do my practice and work in the party.,And one thing led to another, and I won’t bore you with the detail, but one day I showed up at an off-year convention, and I was in — I was in the motel after — the local motel getting changed after the afternoon session, go back to the evening session.,And I’d come down with some young activists — they were a — a little older than me, but still young activists — who were involved in trying to reform the party.  And I was in one of those 8-by-10 bathrooms — you know they have a shower, a toilet, and a sink.  And I got a towel on me and shaving cream, and I hear, “,Bam, bam, bam,,” at my door really loudly.  And I wonder, “What the hell is that?”,I thought it was this guy Bob Cunningham who had a radio show and a cou- — couple of other guys.  So, I say, “Okay, okay, guys.”,And I walked to the door and opened it up and standing there was the former governor of the state of Delaware, Elbert N. Carvel, a big guy, about six-five.,Talked at you like this,.  (Pronounced in an accent.)  (Laughter.)  And the state representative who got defeated four years earlier as a Democratic state rep — who was retired — and one of the — from the family that had more so — more senators appointed than any other family in American history, the — the Tunnells — and a former retired Justice and the — and the state chairman.,And they said — and I’m standing in a towel with shaving cream on my face.  (Laughter.)  And with that, they looked at me and said — they come in and said, “We’re — we’re coming — we just had dinner.  We want to talk to you.”,And I walked in, and I said, “Okay, gentlemen.”  And I ran to the bathroom thinking I could put something on.  (Laughter.)  All I could do is take off the shaving cream.  I had on a towel.  I walked out — two headboards nailed to one side of the wall, the desk to the other side.,And I’m st- — they’re — he’s sitting on the end of the bed.  And I’m sitting down, and they said, “Joe, we just had dinner, and we think you should run for the Senate.”  I said, “Run?  Man, I’m not old enough.”  And the former Justice looked at me he said, “Joe, you obviously didn’t do well in constitutional law.”  (Laughter.)  “You don’t have to be — you have to be 30 to be sworn in, but you can be elected at any age.  You’ll be — 17 days after, you’ll be eligible.,One thing then I — I don’t know about you, but all of us who have some teacher or some professor we really had faith in.  Well, my political philosophy professor at Delaware — which was between Dov- — Newark, Delaware — between Dover and my home — was one of those guys.,And I called him, and I said, “Can I stop by and see you?”  And I remember seeing him and asking him my — a question: What he thinks I should do.  He said, “Joe, remember what Plato said.”  I’m thinking, “What the hell did Plato say?”  (Laughter.)  Seriously, it’s an absolutely true story.  He said, “Joe, the penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves.”  (Laughter.)  And I was opposed to the Vietnam War.,Anyway, one thing led to another.  I ended up running not with any enthusiasm as I started.  But we had the same kind of thing of — just a lot of young people and people who hadn’t been deeply involved.,Just — there was a — we had a picnic for our volunteers at the end of the summer.  And there was ads on the radio, “Do not take I-95 South.  Biden is having a picnic.  There was no accident.”  (Laughter.)  No, I’m serious.  (Laughter.),Nixon won by 60 percent of the vote.  We won by a rousing 3,100 votes.,But my point is, it wasn’t planned.  I love reading these biographies of me that “Biden knew he was going to run for president.  He knew it was going to happen.”,But look, folks, it matters — it matters what we do.  You wouldn’t be here.  You wouldn’t be here doing it — forget me.  I mean, you wouldn’t be here if you didn’t think a lot was at stake.  And we have enormous opportunities — enormous opportunities.,But I know that probably over-answers your question but — (laughter) —,MS.

Biden Jr., welcomed the Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq, Mohammed Shia’a Al-Sudani, to the White House.  The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the enduring strategic partnership between Iraq and the United States and discussed their visions for comprehensive bilateral cooperation under the 2008 U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement.  The President and Prime Minister agreed on the importance of working together to advance regional stability and reinforce and respect Iraqi sovereignty, stability, and security.,President Biden and Prime Minister Sudani affirmed that a diversified and growing Iraqi economy, integrated with the region and the global economic system, is the foundation for lasting stability in the region and prosperity for the Iraqi people.  The two

nation that promotes peace and progress throughout the broader Middle East.,Energy and Environment,President Biden applauded Iraq’s progress towards energy self-sufficiency, and the two leaders discussed Prime Minister Sudani’s interest in future opportunities for cooperation to ensure Iraq becomes self-sufficient by 2030, with help from U.S. companies.  President Biden affirmed continued U.S. support for Iraq’s efforts to modernize its energy sector, reduce methane emissions, improve public health, more reliably provide electricity for the Iraqi people, and complete the electrical grid connections with neighboring countries, including the ongoing efforts to connect Iraq’s grid with Jordan and GCC countries.  The two leaders discussed future plans to develop Iraq’s resources in

longstanding challenges, including the recent arrangement to pay two months of KRG civil servant salaries, and encouraged continued progress.  The President also affirmed U.S. support for strengthening democracy in Iraq, including free, fair, and transparent regional elections in the IKR.,Economy and Finance,President Biden and Prime Minister Sudani discussed Iraq’s progressive efforts to reform the financial and banking sector to connect Iraq to the international economy and increase trade while shielding the Iraqi people from the harmful impacts of corruption and money-laundering.  Through 2023 and 2024, banks in Iraq have expanded their correspondent relationships with international financial institutions to enable trade financing, with the majority of trade finance now occurring through these channels.  The two leaders affirmed the importance of these and other measures to improve the investment climate in Iraq to attract foreign capital and promote economic growth.  The United States and Iraq commit to strengthen their cooperation to achieve greater transparency and collaboration against money-laundering, financing terrorism, fraud, corruption, and sanctionable activity that could undermine the integrity of both countries’ financial systems.  The two sides also committed to support the Central Bank of Iraq to fully wind down the wire auction

territory and people.,Nearly ten years after establishing the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the two leaders discussed the Coalition’s successes in both Iraq and Syria, where all Iraqi security forces including in Kurdistan were critical to the territorial defeat of ISIS.  Both leaders paid tribute to the sacrifices made by Iraqi, United States, and other friendly countries’ military personnel serving side-by-side as partners during the historic campaign against ISIS, as well as the civilians killed by ISIS, including the massacres at Camp Speicher, Mount Sinjar, and Hit.  Prime Minister Sudani emphasized the national effort that was required to defeat ISIS and discussed his affirmative agenda to continue rebuilding Iraq and restore its position as an engine of stability and growth for the broader Middle East.  President Biden noted that the enduring defeat of ISIS would help ensure Iraq’s, the region’s, and the world’s security in the future, as well as its ability to fulfill the Iraqi people’s aspirations to develop economically, attract foreign investment, and provide regional leadership.,Enduring Bilateral Security Cooperation,President Biden and Prime Minister Sudani also discussed the natural evolution of the global D-ISIS Coalition in light of the significant progress that has been made in ten years.  The two leaders expressed their commitment to the ongoing Higher Military Commission (HMC) process and its results, and the three working groups that will assess: the continued threat from ISIS, operational and environmental requirements, and bolstering Iraq’s security force capabilities.  The two leaders affirmed they would review these factors to determine when and how the mission of the Global Coalition in Iraq would end, and transition in an orderly manner to enduring bilateral security partnerships, in accordance with Iraq’s Constitution and the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement.,The leaders further affirmed their intent to

EDT,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.,I was reminiscing with the Prime Minister very briefly as you walked in the door.  Twenty-five years ago, almost to the day, I was standing on the Senate floor arguing for the admission of Czechoslovakia, at the time — the Czech Republic — into NATO.  Twenty-five years.  I was a pretty smart guy.,PRIME MINISTER FIALA:  (Laughs.),PRESIDENT BIDEN:  The best decision we made.  You’ve been a great, great ally.  And we’ve only grown closer and stronger as nations, both the United States and the Czech Republic.,Together, we’re deepening defense cooperation to ensure the security of our people, as well as including the modernization of your military force with the purchase of F-35 aircraft and helos.  It’s just amazing what you’re doing.,And together, we’re going to bolster our energy security and expand our clean power.  We’re going to get to talk about that in some detail in a little bit.,And together, we’re standing — and I can’t tell you how much we appreciate your outspokenness and the support of the people of Czechoslova- — the Czech Republic with defending the people of Ukraine, as defined by what you’ve done.  You continue to just speak out.,I want to thank you for helping — Mr. Prime Minister, for helping secure nearly 1 million rounds of ammunition for Ukraine.  And I’m committed to — we’re committed to doing our part.,The Congress has to pass the continued funding — (coughs) — excuse me — which has significant from the United States and pass our bipartisan national security bill.  They have to do it now — now.  There’s overwhelming support in the House and Senate if they’ll — the Speaker will just let a vote take place.,And, you know, because as the Czech Republic remembers: Russia won’t stop in Ukraine.  Russia will not stop in Ukraine.  The impact on NATO would be significant.  And Putin is going to keep going, putting Europe, the United States, and the entire world at risk if we don’t stop them in Ukraine.,And so, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you, again, for being here today.  I look forward to our discussion.  I’m really delighted

warm welcome.  It’s nice to be here.,The relations between our countries are now very strong.  And they have also a long tradition.  The United States — States had a main role in founding of independent Czechoslovakia.  Our first president, Masaryk, had an American wife.  And the Czech community in the U.S. is largest we have abroad.,Here, I can mention Madeline Albright —,THE PRESIDENT:

between democratic countries is a must.,Mr. President, I appreciate your leadership in support of Ukraine.  We are also doing our best to help Ukraine and to stop Putin’s aggression.,In 1968, I was a little boy.  In 1968, I saw Russian tanks in the streets of my town.  And I don’t want to see this again.,So, we must continue to support Ukraine as long as possible.  That is the reason why we started Czech Ammunition Initiative.  It will provide Ukraine with hundreds of thousands of artillery shells very soon.  It will happen in next few weeks and months.,And Czechia is also country with most Ukrainian refugees per capita in Europe — maybe in the world.,The international situation is very difficult globally, and our cooperation is very important for stability in Central and Eastern Europe.,And you mentioned: I am glad that my government made some important decisions in defense and security.  We agreed on the Defense Cooperation Agreement, and we decided to get F-35 fighter jets for Czech — Czech army.  This is very important.  It will make our cooperation and security much stronger.,Also, business relations are developing very well.  Our trade exchange is bigger every year.  And we have now some Czech companies investing millions of dollars in the U.S. and employing thousands of — thousands of Americans.  I’m very proud of that.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  So are we.,PRIME MINISTER

During the past few months, I’ve had the opportunity to see first-hand how your leadership is pushing this state forward – from strengthening our workforce to investing in women’s health and helping us end cancer as we know it.  Roy, you are an incredible governor and Joe could not ask for a better partner in North Carolina.,Dr. Clarke and Dr. Oakley, thank you for the warm welcome to Greensboro and GTCC today.,I am glad to highlight your Early/Middle College so more students might enroll!,It’s a question every high school student knows all too well. On birthdays, in school hallways, at the dinner table – it can seem like the only thing anyone wants to talk about.,“Well, what do you plan to do next?”,For many students, the answer to what they want to do next isn’t only “I don’t know” – it’s “I don’t know where to start.”,Nearly 60 percent of graduating high school students don’t go directly to a four-year college.,Six out of 10 students.,As a community college professor, I teach students who are part of that 60 percent.,And I see every day how they are still struggling to figure out their next steps, still searching for an answer to that persistent question. Because for most people, a high school diploma alone isn’t enough to find a great career. But that doesn’t mean there’s only one path to success.,President Biden is helping young people and their families find answers.,Last month, he announced Classroom to Career, an ambitious new proposal, partnering with states, giving every student in America the opportunity to take community college courses in high school through dual enrollment.,Classroom to Career reimagines high school education, giving young people a pathway to their careers by exposing them to job training earlier. Or, a head-start on a two- or four-year degree, making college more affordable.,Career-connected learning—programs that bridge the gap between what students learn and the careers they will eventually find—is not a new idea.,Dual enrollment is not a new idea. Many states offer it in some form.,What is new is that President Biden’s entire Administration is committed to making it a reality for all students through unprecedented collaboration and historic investments.,He sees that this pipeline of support from high school to college to career is the future of our workforce. And that’s why we’re here today.,North Carolina has been a leader in providing those opportunities, and is exemplary in transforming high school into a place that prepares students for jobs.,In just a moment, we will have the opportunity to hear from students and administrators about how these programs are doing just that.,And it’s not just happening in Greensboro, or Asheboro, or Dobson. It’s all across the state.,I just visited Pitt Community College. I met incredible high school students in their college classrooms:  One was getting his associate degree – training to repair cars, and another showed us how she’s learning to detect impurities in medications in her biotechnology class.,These are the skills that are needed for their future careers.  And, they’re getting them in high school!,This isn’t a Democrat or Republican idea. It’s an American idea, championed by leaders from all sides of the political spectrum.,Joe ran for president to help rebuild the middle class, and in the last three years he’s created more than 15 million jobs.,Industries like biotechnology, manufacturing, and clean energy are thriving in North Carolina, and businesses are looking for workers.,Classroom to Career is the link that will give high school students the skills they need to fill the jobs Joe created.,This is going to change lives, lift up families, and grow our economy.,It’s what we need to do today to open up all the possibilities of tomorrow – for our young people, our communities, and our country.,I can’t wait to hear more about your experiences.,Thank you for spending time with me today.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",15-04-24,Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by First Lady Jill Biden at Visit to Guilford Technical Community College,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/04/15/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-first-lady-jill-biden-at-visit-to-guilford-technical-community-college/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,James S. Brady Press Briefing Room,1:39 P.M. EDT,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everyone.,Q    Good afternoon.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I just have a — just something really quick at the top.,Is the — the mics are always funky.  Is it funky?,Q    It’s normal.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No?,Q    You sound good.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, okay.  (Laughter.)  Let’s get going.,With all seriousness, though, it was obviously a very busy weekend at the White House.,The President spent hours in the Situation Room, closely monitoring the latest developments in the Middle East with his national security team.  He was engaged in extensive diplo- — diplomacy, speaking with the Israeli Prime Minister on Saturday night and convening a call with G7 leaders on Sunday morning.,The President also organized a joint statement with the G7 that strongly condemned Iran’s brazen and unprecedented attack.,Today, the President received an updated briefing from his national security team and, as you all know, met with the leaders of Iraq and will meet with the leaders of the Czech Republic later this afternoon.,With that, we have my NSC colleague, Admiral John Kirby, who’s here to do a much deeper dive and also take your questions on the Middle East.,(A laptop computer chimes.),MR. KIRBY:  Somebody is due soon.  (Laughter.),Good afternoon.,Q    Good afternoon.,MR. KIRBY:  As you all know and certainly Karine restated it, Iran and its proxies operating in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq also conducted an unprecedented attack on the State of Israel with over 300 weapons, including more than 100 ballistic missiles, as well as land-attack cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles or drones.,President Biden instructed the United States to defend Israel to the maximum extent possible and defeat that attack, and we did.,With the support of our partners, the United States enabled Israel to spectacular- — spectacularly defeat it.,Despite launching more than those 300 weapons from Iran and the region, Israel and a coalition of partners were able to defeat 99 percent of the attacks.  There is virtually no infrastructure damage to Israel.,But their attack requires an unequivocal condemnation from the international community.  And so, as Karine said, the President convened the G7 yesterday, and they have forcefully condemned that attack and urged for calm and de-escalation.,And I’d like to take just a few minutes to correct the record on a few points that have come out in the last several hours.,I’ve seen reporting that the Iranians meant to fail, that this spectacular and embarrassing failure was all by design.  I’ve also seen Iran say that they provided early warning to help Israel prepare its defenses and limit any potential damage.,All of this is categorically false.  To coin the phrase from the President — or steal a phrase from the President, it’s “malarkey.”,This attack failed because it was defeated by Israel, by the United States, and by a coalition of other partners committed to Israel’s defense.,So, let’s be straight.  Given the scale of this attack, Iran’s intent was clearly to cause significant destruction and casualties.,Iranian leaders launched so many missiles and other munitions because they knew that many were going to be defeated, but the aim was to get as many as of them through Israeli — Israel’s defenses as possible.,Now, I’ve also seen this speculation about messages passed forth and warnings.  We did receive messages from Iran, and they received messages from us too.  But there was never any message to us or to anyone else on the timeframe, the targets, or the type of response.,In fact, before yesterday, it was presumed that 100 ballistic missiles might overwhelm even the best defensive systems.  That was Iran’s intent.  And as you all saw for yourself, it didn’t work.,This attack was defeated thanks to our preparations, to a coalition of committed partners, and to Israel’s remarkable defensive systems.,And I want to focus on that last point for just a moment.  Israel today is in a far stronger strategic position than it was only a few days ago.,Iran’s vaunted missile program –- something it has used to threaten Israel and the region –- proved to be far less effective.,Israel’s defenses, on the other hand, proved even better than many had long assumed.  Israel’s defense was strengthened by a coalition of countries led by the United States and working together.,The United States has never before so extensively and so directly defended Israel from attack.,To ensure that that continues to be the case, the House of Representatives must urgently pass the national security supplemental, which has already passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.  That supplemental includes funding that the President requested for the Iron Dome and David’s Sling system — systems that saved countless lives this weekend and have saved many lives from Hamas and from Hezbollah rockets over the past six months.,Passing that bill is the fastest and surest way to get Israel the aid it needs.  And we must act urgently to replenish Israel’s air defenses, just as Congress must act urgently to replenish — replenish Ukraine’s air defenses, which also continue to be attacked every single day, with the same Irania- — Iranian-made drones.,Now, finally, much of the world today is standing with Israel.,When the President spoke to G7 leaders yesterday, they were unified in their condemnation of Iran and their determination to hold Iran accountable.,At the President’s direction, our teams are now following up with G7 capitals on new multilateral sanctions to target Iran’s missile and other nefarious programs.  G7 countries that had yet to designate the IRGC a terrorist organization are now considering doing so.,And going forward, we will be working to further isolate Iran internationally and increase economic and other forms of pressure.,So, that’s the upshot here: a stronger Israel, a weaker Iran, a more unified alliance of partners.  That was not Iran’s intent when it launched this attack on Saturday night — not even close.  And again, they failed.  They failed utterly.,Now, as you also know, President Biden is welcoming both the Iraqi Prime Minister and Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic to the White House.,The President and Prime Minister al-Sudani from Iraq will discuss the U.S. and Iraq’s shared vision for our broad, multifaceted relationship.  During the meeting, these leaders will reaffirm their commitment to advancing regional stability, to expanding opportunities for Iraq’s people, and reinforcing Iraq’s sovereignty, security, and stability.,The Iraqi Prime Minister will be here for almost a week.  And in that time, he will meet a range of administration officials, including both Secretary Blinken at the State Department and Secretary Austin at the Defense Department.  He will have opportunities to share his priorities and vision for Iraq with a variety of audiences here in Washington and in other parts of the United States.,Now, of course, the President will be taking the opportunity to discuss how we will continue to work with Prime Minister Sudani to defuse regional tensions and to prevent Iraq from being drawn into conflict.  Iraq, the President firmly believes, is central to the region’s stability.,And then, later, as Karine previewed, he’ll have a chance to meet with President — I’m sorry — Prime Minister Fiala to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Czech Republic as a NATO Ally.,Over the past 25 years, our alliance has grown stronger and the relationship between our two countries have grown even closer as we’ve deepened defense cooperation, including through the Czech Republic’s purchase of 24 F-35 fighters earlier this year.,The President will congratulate the Prime Minister on legislation that Czechia recently passed requiring it to spend at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense, which, as you know, is the NATO goal.,Lead- — the leaders will also discuss their strong support for Ukraine, and the President will thank the Prime Minister for leading an effort to help secure nearly 1 million rounds of ammunition for Ukraine.,And one more thing, if you’ll just bear with me.  I’m almost done.  Today marks the one-year conflict in Sudan.  Since fighting erupted a year ago, civilians have been forced to bear the brunt of this senseless conflict: thousands have been killed and wounded; women and girls have been kidnapped and assaulted; hundreds of thousands of families have been displaced; communities and livelihoods have been utterly destroyed; and famine, now, is threatening to take hold.,That’s why the United States continues to commit resources to create conditions for a potential peace process, to hold accountable actors who are seeking to sow more violence, and to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches the civilians who urgently need it.,We reiterate our calls for all parties in this conflict to lay down their weapons and put an end to this intolerable violence for the future of Sudan but, most of all, for the future of the Sudanese people.,Thank you.  Appreciate your patience.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Seung Min.,Q    Israel’s military chief just said, quote, “There will be a response to the attack from Iran.”  So, does the U.S. have any indication of what those next steps are from Israel?,MR. KIRBY:  We would let the Israelis speak to that.,Q    Does the U.S. expect to be consulted in advance of them taking any next steps?,MR. KIRBY:  I — I won’t get into our diplomatic conversations or expectations.  The Israeli government will determine for themselves if there’s going to be a response and what that response is going to look like.,Q    And are you able to discuss the specific roles played by other members of the regional coalition from over the weekend, specifically Jordan and Saudi Arabia, whether they helped shoot down missiles or what other actions they may have done over the weekend?,MR. KIRBY:  No, I think we’ll let other members of the coalition speak for themselves.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    John, Israel is reportedly looking at options that would send a message to Iran but not cause casualties.  Is the administration presenting alternatives to Netanyahu?,MR. KIRBY:  This is a — these — this is an Israeli decision to make, whether and how they’ll respond to what Iran did on Saturday.  And we’re going to leave it squarely with them.,Q    Their decision to make, but are you making suggestions?,MR. KIRBY:  We are not involved in their decision-making process about a potential response.,Q    And just — is the President — does he have any plans to speak to Netanyahu again?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything on the calendar to speak to.  But, look, I mean, they’ve — they’ve spoken frequently over the last six months.  They’ll absolutely speak again at the appropriate time.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  John, just one day before the attack, President Biden issued a warning to Iran: “Don’t.”  And now the U.S. is not taking any part in an Israeli reprisal.  So, does that signal to Iran that it can defy the U.S. without facing any consequences?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know, man.  If I’m sitting in Tehran and I’m taking a look at what just happened on Saturday night, I don’t think I’d be betting that the United States is not willing to get engaged here and help defend Israel.  I mean, you had American fighter pilots in the air, in combat operation, shooting down drones and missiles that were heading towards — towards Israel, as well as U.S. Navy destroyers at sea, knocking them down from there.,So, the message should be very clear to anybody: When the President says we’re going to take our commitments to the region seriously, when we’re going to help Israel defend itself.  We got skin in the game, and we proved that.,Q    I understand what you’re saying about deterrence.  But what about the consequences?,MR. KIRBY:  As I just said and Karine also lead in, he had a conversation with G7 leaders.  He’ll be engaging with other allies and partners.  We have achiev- — we have seen swift condemnations about what Iran did from the international community.  And we’re going to be working with international partners to — to work up options to hold Iran appropriately accountable.,Q    And then just on the logistics of this.  With roughly 300 drones and missiles shot down, can you talk about how you will assess the debris fields and the shrapnel and how much that impacted people on the ground?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, we’re not going to be doing any kind of an assessment of the impact on the ground.  The Israeli Defense Forces and Israeli officials have already been out and about looking at the impact on the ground.  There were very few missiles that got through, and the only damage that was done — it was very minor damage to one airbase in — in Israel that did not even put that airbase out of commission.,The Israelis have already spoken to this.  I believe they’ve already released imagery of some of the things they found on the ground.,Sadly, a young girl — an innocent civilian, less than 10 years old — was severely wounded.  That was the only casualty that we’re aware of.,Q    Thank you, John.,Q    Thank you.  John, a couple of questions on Iran and then on Iraq, on the Prime Minister visit.  You just said that the White House were not informed of the timing of the Iranian attack on Israel, but the President told us that he — the attack is going to be sooner than later, and almost a day after, the attack happened.  So, just can you explain this one?,MR. KIRBY:  I never said we didn’t have an idea.  I never said we didn’t have information that — that we could — that we could act on and speak to our Israeli counterparts about.,What I said was: Iran never delivered a message giving us the time and the targets.,Q    The exact timing, you mean?,MR. KIRBY:  No, no.  No, no, no.  No timing.  I mean, I want to be clear: This whole narrative out there that Iran passed us a message with what they were going to do is ridiculous.,Q    Okay.  Do you believe that Iranian nuclear sites is a legitimate target?,MR. KIRBY:  You’re — I’m not going to get into targeting discussions here from the podium.,Q    Okay.  Let me ask you about the Prime Minister.  Is the White House satisfied with the way that the Iraqi government is reining in the militias in Iraq, considering they are one of the proxies of the Iranian regime?,MR. KIRBY:  We’re going to — we’re going to have an in-depth discussion with the Prime Minister and his team about the continued activities of militia groups in Iraq.  And — and we’ll reinforce our views about how seriously we take the force protection of our — our troops and our facilities there.,And we’ll also expect — I fully expect that — that we’ll talk with the Prime Minister about the counter-ISIS mission in Iraq and its — and its potential future.,Q    And finally, just when he said, “in the spirit of partnership, we disagree with the United States,” and he mentioned something like “we need a new system for international law — to respect international law, international humanitarian law, protection of civilians, and diplomatic missions.”,So, he’s hinting at the Israeli attack in Damascus.  He’s also hinting about not doing enough to respect international law.  Is this a point of disagreement between you and the Iraqi government?,MR. KIRBY:  You’ll have to talk to the Prime Minister about what he meant by those comments.  Iraq is a — a key partner, one we really value.  We wouldn’t be having this meeting today, he wouldn’t be having meetings this week if it wasn’t an important relationship.,As I said, the President believe — believes that Iraq is critical to regional stability.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Danny.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Thanks, Admiral.   You said just now that this — that Iran’s attack was a spectacular and embarrassing failure.  Do you and does the President believe that Israel should now take this as a win and show restraint?,MR. KIRBY:  I — I know where the context of the question is coming in.  During his conversation with the Prime Minister on Saturday night, first of all, he congratulated the Prime Minister for the exceptional effort by the Israeli Defense Forces and, of course, commended, as you would expect the Commander-In-Chief to do, the participation of U.S. forces in this coalition and the great work that was done.,I mean, it’s easy to — you know, I was looking some — looking at some of the video before I came out here that’s running on some of your networks, and, you know, it’s easy to look at that like it’s some kind of a computer game, right?  It looks so simple — things getting knocked out of sky.,Let me tell you something: It’s not simple.  It’s hard.  And a lot of planning and preparation had to go into that and a lot of coordination.  And the President talked to the Prime Minister about that.,He also noted that this was an extraordinary success, a military success.  And that that success alone, just for itself, speaks volumes about Israel’s standing in the region — that they — they don’t stand alone, that a coalition came to help them defend themselves.  It also says a lot about Israel’s military superiority, and it says just as much about Iran’s military inferiority when it came to this particular set of attacks.,And the President urged the Prime Minister to think about what that success says all by itself to the rest of the region.  He — he —,Q    You mean in terms of thinking about — I mean, but — think about the restraint about, you know, the — maybe this should not go further than — you know, further escalation?,MR. KIRBY:  All I’ll — all I’ll say is: The President, from the beginning of this conflict on October 7th, has been steadfast and consistent.  We don’t want to see a war with Iran.  We don’t want to see a broader regional conflict.  We will do what we have to do to defend Israel.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Asma.,Q    Yeah, does the — this administration believe Israel will indeed strike Iran?  I mean, is it your assessment that that is inevitable at this point?,MR. KIRBY:  That’s going to be up to the Prime Minister and the War Cabinet to speak to.,Q    But your assessment or the administration’s assessment?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to provide intelligence assessments from here.  As I — as far as I know, the War Cabinet is still debating and talking about their next steps.  I think I’m going to let them speak to whatever their next steps might be.,Q    And if I may also ask one question on Gaza.  What is the administration’s assessment of the timeline for a Rafah invasion, given the conversations that you all have been having?,MR. KIRBY:  Again, you’re asking me a question that really should be asked to the Israeli Defense Forces and the Prime Minister, not —,Q    No, but I know —,MR. KIRBY:  — not to the United States.,Q    — you guys have been having conversations.  I just want to get a sense of are these, like, ongoing conversations still?  Are you (inaudible)?,MR. KIRBY:  (Laughs.)  I — I — yes, of course we’re talking to the Israelis all the time.  Now, obviously, in the last 48 hours particularly, the conversation has been about what Iran did.  But yes, we have — continue to talk to them about what’s going on down in Rafah.  And we expect — hope in coming days to be able to have yet another round of discussions with them about what their intentions are with respect to Rafah, but the focus, rightly, right now is on what Iran just did.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  J.J.,Q    On the U.S. military.  Given whatever the White House and President Biden know about what’s going to happen next in the Middle East, are there any fresh U.S. military preparations?,MR. KIRBY:  Fresh — fresh military preparations for?,Q    Whatever.  (Laughter.),Q    Wide open.,MR. KIRBY:  Yes.  I mean — (laughter) — we — we’re always looking at force protection in the region.  We’re always looking at our force posture.  We’re always evaluating it based on the threats and the challenges.  You can expect that Secretary Austin and the entire team over there at the Department of Defense is going to stay vigilant to whatever the threat might be.,Q    Thanks.  You said a moment ago that it’s ridiculous –this narrative that Iran provide — provided some advanced notice about specifics here.  But where we’re hearing that from, you know, specifically is U.S. Ally, Turkey; U.S. partner, Iraq.  That’s where that information is coming from.  So, what is the discrepancy exactly that’s happening there?,MR. KIRBY:  I can’t possibly answer that question, Trevor.  All I’m telling you is it’s nonsense.  I — I mean, it — think about this for a minute.  Can you imagine a world in which Iran would pick up the phone and say, “Hey, we’re about to try to swack Israel with 300 cruise missiles and drones.  We just wanted to let you know it’s coming.  And oh, by the way, here’s what we’re going to hit.”  I’m sorry.  It just didn’t happen.,I can’t account for what sources might be telling you all about what they heard.  I’m telling you what we heard.,And while we did get a message from Iran and we passed messages to Iran as well, which I won’t get into the details of, none of it was, “Here’s the targets.  Here’s the timeframe.  Here’s the munitions we’re going to put on target.”,Q    And on that subject of communications with Iran generally, you’ve said, without preconditions, you’re willing to sit down with North Korea.  Does the same apply to Iran and to reopening some diplomatic discussions —,MR. KIRBY:  No.,Q    — with them?,No.  And do you want to elaborate on —,MR. KIRBY:  No.,Q    — why that is?  (Laughter.)  Okay.,As far as sanctions in response to Iran, Iranian oil production is now higher than it was two years ago.  Is there a reason that you aren’t taking more steps against Iranian oil exports?  And does it have to do with domestic political pressures around gas prices?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have any — as you know, we don’t preview sanctions.  And I’m not going to start doing that today, except to note what I said in my opening statement, that part of the discussion with the G7 leaders was the possibility of additional sanctions on Iran unilaterally and — and hopefully multilaterally, but we’ll see where that goes.,Q    And anything on — on where the oil prices or oil — oil experts are coming from Iran and — and whether you want to stop that?,MR. KIRBY:  Again, I won’t get ahead of economic pressure tools that we might be applying in the future.  We’re working our way through that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    A U.S. official told CNN over the weekend that the Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, asked his Israeli counterpart to notify the U.S. ahead of any potential response to the Iran attack.  Is there a confidence that Israel will provide that advanced certification to the U.S.?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ll just tell you that we are and will remain in very close contact with our Israeli counterparts.,Q    So, do you expect to get an advance notification?,MR. KIRBY:  We will stay in close contact with our Israeli counterparts.,Q    On the hostage talks.  Hamas rejected the latest proposal.  The U.S. has said that Hamas rejecting it — has rejected the deal.  But do you think Israel needs to allow Gazans to return home unrestricted, and should the IDF pull back so they can do that, that being a sticking point?,MR. KIRBY:  First of all, we don’t consider it a dead letter.  As far as we’re concerned, there’s a viable proposal on the table and Hamas ought to take it.  And we’re not letting up on the idea of negotiating for a hostage deal so we can get a ceasefire, so we can get more aid in, but that’s still very much an active football in our — in our heads.,And as for movement north, we — what we’ve talked to the Israelis about is you got a million and a half people that are seeking refuge down in Rafah.  It’s by far the largest concentration of Palestinians in Gaza.  They need to be accounted for.  Whatever kind of military operation they’re thinking about doing in Rafah or anywhere else, to your point about moving north, they have to provide safe venues for them to do that.  They have to provide food, water, medicine, shelter.  All that has to be baked in to whatever future military operations happen on the ground in Gaza.,Q    That does sound, though, like you’re saying that Israel should consider allowing Gazans to move up north, which has been a sticking point in those hostage talks.,MR. KIRBY:  We want to see them — we want to see them account for the future safety and security of the more than a million refugees that are now taking refuge down near Rafah with whatever — baked in to whatever military plans they might have for operations on the ground.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Francesca.,Q    On the ceasefire negotiations.  A U.S. official said yesterday that the latest proposal included almost everything that Hamas had asked for.  And so, how is it that the negotiations are at a standstill at this point?  Is the U.S. planning another counterproposal?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know of a new proposal.  There is a very good proposal on the table that CIA Director Bill Burns helped negotiate in Cairo a week or so ago that the Israelis were able to get behind.  And now it’s time for Hamas to step up and take that deal.  It will allow for dozens of the hostages — the most at-risk pool of them — to get out, and it’ll allow for about six weeks of a ceasefire so we can get some calm and we can increase humanitarian assistance.,There’s a deal on the table.  That’s what Hamas needs to take.,Q    And when the President spoke yesterday to congressional leaders, did he receive any sort of a commitment from House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring the bipartisan national security supplemental bill to the House floor this week?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ll let the Speaker speak to whatever his plans might be.  Certainly, we heard from Leader McConnell and from — and from Leader Jeffries about the importance of — of mak- — of passing this supplemental and getting it — and getting it on — on its way.,And as I said in my opening statement, the fastest way — I mean, you’ve got — you got two good friends here — Israel and Ukraine — that — very different fights, to be sure, but active fights for their sovereignty and for their safety and security.  And time is not on anyone’s side here in either case.,So, they need to move quickly on this.  And the best way to get that aid into the hands of the IDF and into the hands of the Ukrainian soldiers is to pass that bipartisan bill that the Senate passed.,Q    I understand that that’s the — your pref- –preference, the bipartisan bill that the Senate passed.  But is the White House opposed to an approach that takes the issues separately — Israel only or —,MR. KIRBY:  We are opposed to a standalone bill that would just work on Israel.  As we’ve seen proposed, we would — we would oppose a standalone bill, yes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Gabe.,Q    Admiral, I know you said it was Israel’s decision.  But ask it bluntly: If Israel retaliates against Iran, would the U.S. support that?,MR. KIRBY:  To answer bluntly: I’m not going to get into hypotheticals.  We don’t want to see a war with,Ukraine,[Iran].  We don’t want to see a wider conflict.  As the President said to the Prime Minister on Saturday night, we will continue to do what we have to do to help Israel defend itself.,But you’re asking me to get ahead of, as far as I know, a decision that the War Cabinet hasn’t even made.,Q    But if it were to happen, does —,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, it’s a — it’s a terrific hypothetical, Gabe, that I’m just not going to entertain.,Q    Thanks.  John, has President Biden considered maybe beefing up the public Iran posture to be more than just one word?,MR. KIRBY:  You’re — you’re referring to “Don’t”?,Q    Yeah.  Because he said, “Don’t” —,MR. KIRBY:  And so, let’s talk about —,Q    — and they did it anyway.,MR. KIRBY:  And let’s talk about —,Q    So, now what?,MR. KIRBY:  — what we did, Peter.  Let’s talk about “don’t” and “did.”  Let’s talk about Saturday night.  He made it clear that he didn’t want to see escalation in the region.  And —,Q    And then there was —,MR. KIRBY:  Let me finish.  He added military resources to the region right after October 7th.  And then, when we had an inkling that this kind of thing was coming, he added even more military resources to the region: more destroyers that were capable of shooting down ballistic missiles, fighter s- — a fighter squadron that was able to shoot down drones.  And that’s what we did.,So, you can talk about the “don’t” word all you want.  But let’s talk about what did happen.  And what did happen was Iran utterly failed.  And if I’m sitting in Tehran right now, I’m betting that President Biden takes it pretty seriously.  When he says “don’t escalate,” he’s going to act to make sure that you can’t.  And they didn’t.,Yes, they fired an unprecedented amount of munitions.  But how much of a success did they have, Peter?  None, zero, very little infrastructure.  It was an embarrassing failure for the Supreme Leader, for the IRGC.,Q    Now that we know that the Iranians do not listen to President Biden’s public warnings, is there any regret here about unfreezing billions of dollars for Iranian leaders during the President’s administration?,MR. KIRBY:  What unfreezing are you talking about?,Q    He unfroze billions of dollars.  There was a —,MR. KIRBY:  For Iranian leaders?,Q    Yeah.,MR. KIRBY:  Really?  I don’t think so.,Q    Okay.  You guys say —,MR. KIRBY:   So, first of all —,Q    — it’s for humanitarian purposes.  But doesn’t that —,MR. KIRBY:  But you don’t believe me.,Q    On — well, doesn’t that free up money for them to spend on other stuff?  Where do you get the money for an unprecedented number of munitions to — to fire at Israel?,MR. KIRBY:  So, first of all, I’m betting if they’re sitting in Tehran, they’re taking it seriously when President Biden says he’s going to defend Israel.  We put skin in the game — a whole heck of a lot of it — and knocked almost everything out of the sky.  So, I’m betting they’re taking it pretty seriously.,And as for this — this unfreezing, that — none of that fund — none of those funds — funds set up in an account, by the way, by the previous administration — goes directly to the Supreme Leader of the IRGC.  It can only be used for humanitarian purposes.  And we’re watching that account very, very closely to make sure that that’s what happens.,Q    And you guys often defend all the trips to Delaware by saying, “The President is not on vacation.  He’s working.  He can be the President from anywhere.”  So, why did he have to come back on Saturday?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, we got indications — shortly after arriving, we got better, firmer intelligence and information about the specific timing of what we expected to be this Iranian attack, and the President didn’t bat an eye before getting back on that helicopter and coming back.,And he was here all Saturday night in the Situation Room, from mid-afternoon until late at night, getting real-time updates from General Kurilla and from his defense team all throughout the night, including calling Prime Minister Netanyahu right from the Situation Room.,And as Karine mentioned, on Sunday, he was right back at it again, working the G7, calling King Abdullah.  I don’t know what else to tell you.  He had a very busy, full weekend.,Q    John, on Iran.  What is the current thinking on whether Iran’s Rev",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lutionary Guard should be designated as a terrorist organization?,MR. KIRBY:  We already have.,Q    And then, just do you have any update on getting additional humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza?  You had said —,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.,Q    — last week that you added 300 trucks on Wednesday.  Within where — where the weekend (inaudible)?,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  Forgive me.,Q    (Inaudible.),MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know if Karine might have already briefed this out to you guys.  But, you know, over the last week or so, more than 2,000 trucks have gotten in.  And even throughout the course of the weekend, as Israel was dealing with a quite daunting attack by Iran, they were still able to get some trucks into Gaza.,So, in these early days, after the previous phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu where the President talked about the need to increase humanitarian assistance, we have seen Israel take steps to in- — to — to do exactly that.,Now, as we’ve also said, it’s still not enough.  The — the need is dire.  And what we’re going to be doing is watching for a sustained commitment to doing that over time.  But — but thus far, there has been an increase in humanitarian assistance.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Just one on the timing of the wa- — of any type of warning.  So, are you saying Iran never told a U.S. partner — Switzerland, Oman, any of them — Turkey, Iraq — never gave them any information about the attack they were preparing to launch and that that information never reached the U.S.?,MR. KIRBY:  The United States had no messages from Iran or from anybody else, as I said in my opening statement, that — that offered a specific timeframe or a specific set of targets or the types of weapons that they were going to fire.,Q    So, just concretely, why would U.S. partners in Turkey, Jordan, Iraq lie about passing along Iranian messages about any forthcoming attack to the U.S.?,MR. KIRBY:  Look, I’m not — I’m not calling anybody a liar here.  I’m telling you, from our perspective, what we knew and what we didn’t know.  And we were able to help with Israel’s defenses because we had information that we had received and Israel had received through our own — our own efforts, but it never came as some sort of message from Iran with, I mean, the — the timing and the target.,I — it’s — it’s — it kind of boggles my mind that anybody would believe that Iran would pick up the phone and tell the United States, who — who they know —,Q    (Inaudible) the United States.,MR. KIRBY:  — who — who they know has been very, very directly involved with helping Israel defend itself and very public about doing that, and detail the times and the targets.,Look, this to me seems like a lot of, you know, Monday morning quarterbacking kind of stuff — would have, could have, should have.  And — and maybe they want to make it appear like, you know, this was some sort of small pinprick of an attack that they never meant to succeed.,You can’t throw that much metal in the air, which they did, in the timeframe in which they did it and convince anybody, realistically, that you weren’t trying to cause casualties and you weren’t calling — trying to cause damage.  They absolutely were.,Q    And just one more.  Is the meeting with Israli — Israeli officials on Rafah still — is that happening this week?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have a date for you.  We’re still trying to get that nailed down.  As I said earlier, we’d like to continue those conversations.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  Hi, Admiral.  House Majority Leader Scalise said on Friday that Speaker Johnson was negotiating with the White House modifications to the Ukraine aid package.  Are you — what is being negotiated?  And you just categorically said that the White House opposes a standalone Israel bill —,MR. KIRBY:  That’s right.,Q    — supplemental.  Are you also opposed to changes to the supplemental?  For example, changing —,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah.  I —,Q    — aid to alone —,MR. KIRBY:  I know it would make your jobs a lot easier if I negotiated this thing up here in public.,Q    (Laughs.)  No, I just —,MR. KIRBY:  But I’m not going to do that.  You’re right.  The President did have an opportunity to speak with Speaker Johnson and other congressional leaders, including — including McConnell and Jeffries.  And he made it clear that the best and the fastest way to stand by our allies and partners is for the House of Representatives to take up the bipartisan bill that the Senate passed.,Q    But are you also opposed to the modifications and changes, as you oppose the standalone?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ve answered the question.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thank you so much, John.  First of all, thank you for your dedication this weekend in keeping us all informed.  I think we all saw more of us than our own families, which was really cool.  I got —,MR. KIRBY:  You certainly saw more of me than my family did.  (Laughter.),Q    I got two questions.  First of all, administration officials told us on Sunday that they had help from India, China, and Iraq.  Can you just detail, you know, some — give us some of the details on that?  And does that represent a move forward in U.S.-China relations, that you were able to cooperate on (inaudible)?,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, as I said earlier, I think I’ll let other countries speak to their participation and cooperation and the degree that the — that they’re comfortable doing that.  I can only speak for the United States and what we did.,Q    Does this represent a step forward for the U.S.-China —,MR. KIRBY:  I think it — what it — I think what it says is — without getting into the specific contributions of other countries, as I said in my opening statement, it shows that Israel is not standing alone, that — I mean, that, unlike Iran, which is increasingly isolated on the world stage, Israel has friends.  Israel has great skill, great professionalism, great military capability.  And that’s not by accident.  All of that comes from the support that they get, particularly from the United States, but other countries as well.,Q    And then, if the U.S. can — and allies can help shoot down Iranian drones over Israel, why can’t they do the same over Ukraine?,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I knew this question was coming too.  Look, different conflicts.  Different conflicts, different airspace, different threat picture.  And the President has been clear since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, the United States is not going to be involved in that — that conflict in a combat role.  And we haven’t.,We have been providing Ukraine the tools that they need to help defend their airspace.  And, unfortunately, we can’t do that right now because we don’t have that national security supplemental funding that — that they so desperately need.,Q    The Assyrian Christians are the indigenous people of Iraq.  And before liberation, they had about two and a half million, and they’re down to nearly 200,000.  And just last month, the Iraqi Supreme Court removed all of their — had five seats in the Kurdish parliament for many decades, and those were renewed — were removed.  Have you — has that come up in any of the discussions?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ll take the question.,Q    Thank you.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  And thank you, John, for all you did over the weekend.  I have two questions.  First, you mentioned the shipping of aid to Gaza from Israel.  Do we have a U.S. consular official at the border who is confirming that the aid actually gets there?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m not aware of a consular presence at the border.  But we’re in, as I said, constant touch with our Israeli counterparts.  We — you know, we also have David Satterfield, who is the President’s Special Envoy, for that exact purpose.  And, I mean, he’s — he’s like Waldo.  I mean, he’s all over the place — (laughter) — constantly up and down, I mean, making sure that that stuff is getting in and keeping the President and the whole team fully informed.,Q    My other question is that: Given the recent developments with Iran, is the U.S. going to step up its contacts with the opposition to the current regime in Tehran?  And I mean, specifically, exile groups in the United States, plus, on the ground, the Baluchi, Azeri, the Kurds, and the Sunni, who are in opposition to the regime.,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know of any such efforts in the wake of the — the attacks.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  A couple more.  Way in the back, go ahead.,Q    Thank you, John.  Why is the U.S. not going to participate in a counteroffensive?,MR. KIRBY:  Again, I think I’ve answered this question.  The President had a good chat with the Prime Minister.  We talked about the incredible success that the — that we and they achieved on Saturday night and the message that success sends not only to the region but also to Iran as well.,And as I’ve also said and as the President has certainly said, we’re not looking for a war with Iran.  We’re not looking to broaden and deepen this conflict in the region.,Q    How exactly is he trying to de-escalate this situation?,MR. KIRBY:  Everything the President has been doing since the 7th of October has been designed to try to de-escalate and to try to keep the conflict from widening and deepening.  And that includes the moves that he made in the last 10, 12 days to add resources to the region so that we could help Israel better defend itself.,And, my goodness, it all paid off.  I mean, instead of having a hundred ballistic missiles land inside of Israel and cause untold damage to infrastructure and to human lives, none of that occurred.  And the reason none of it occurred was because the President was ahead of the problem set.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Brian.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  John, just a couple of follow-ups.  The coalition to put together limiting Iran’s development of nuclear weapons, is that still solid in the face of what’s going on?,MR. KIRBY:  As the President has said, we’d love nothing better than to be able to solve Iranian nuclear progress — nuclear weapons progress through diplomacy.  Unfortunately, that’s not an option right now because the — the Iranians, well before any of this, just weren’t negotiating in good faith.  None of the diplomatic efforts were — were paying off.,And so, that effort kind of fell moribund as we look for other ways to increase pressure on Iran.,The President has also said that while he would prefer to deal with this threat diplomatically, he also will make sure that he’s got options and choices available to him —,Q    But —,MR. KIRBY:  — to ensure that Iran never achieves a nuclear weapons capability.,Q    But the countries that were backing that coalition — still a member?  They’re all — China, Russia —,MR. KIRBY:  I mean, you’re talking about a process that’s just moribund right now, Brian.,Q    Okay.  And —,MR. KIRBY:  I mean, it —,Q    And so, the other follow-up: the container ship.  Was there — there have been rumors.  Is there any — the container ship that was seized by Iran, was there anything of a sensitive nature on it?  Do we know what was on it?,MR. KIRBY:  I think I’d refer you to the Pentagon on that.  I don’t have an update on the cargo.,Q    I — finally, I — well, I want to thank you for using which “swack” and — and, of course, “Where’s Waldo?”,MR. KIRBY:  I’m going to hear about that one from my wife.  (Inaudible.)  (Laughter.),Q    But the — but at the end, you understand the reason why the question about advanced knowledge, because the President did come back early.  And I think you spoke to it —,MR. KIRBY:  I didn’t say — I never said we didn’t have an advanced sense of what the — I —,What I said was: We didn’t get that sense from the Iranians sending us a telegram.,Q    Right.  But — but, as Peter asked, I believe, there was — we were told not specifics, but that something was going to occur.,MR. KIRBY:  No.  I don’t —,Q    Clear that one up for me.,MR. KIRBY:  It’s not about being told.  I think you all understand: We have lots of tools and vehicles, through intelligence and other information methods, to glean in- — to glean a picture of what an adversary may or may not do.  Now, sometimes it’s right.  Sometimes it’s not 100 percent right.,We had a good sense of what Iran was planning to do, and we achieved that level of situational awareness on our own and working with our Israeli counterparts.  The notion — the idea that Iran sent us an email or picked up the phone and told us what they were planning to do is just ludicrous.  It didn’t happen.  I don’t know how else to be more clear about it.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Andrew.   And then we’ll wrap it up.,Q    Thank you, John.  And Happy Tax Day.  (Inaudible) here.  (Laughter.),MR. KIRBY:  (Inaudible.),Q    There’s been reporting — there’s been reporting that — (laughter).,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Inaudible.),MR. KIRBY:  She’s right.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Right?,MR. KIRBY:  You’re right.,Q    Okay.  So, there’s been reporting that the President suggested to the Prime Minister that Israel take the win and not go further with an offensive response.,MR. KIRBY:  I’ve seen that report, yeah.,Q    I — I have colleagues who are reporting that Israel is very much in the process of planning an offensive response to — to these — to this weekend’s attacks.  Given the political situation in Israel — Prime Minister Netanyahu’s coalition, some of which is a bit extreme, and his own situation — does the President have faith that the Prime Minister will not escalate the situation out of his own political interests, as opposed to genuine Israeli security interests?  And then I have an unrelated one for you.,MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to be able to get into Prime Minister Netanyahu’s psychology or his political calculations or what’s going into his decision-making process.,Q    I’m asking if the President is concerned about this, though.,MR. KIRBY:  What I would tell you is that the President and the Prime Minister speak frequently, certainly as appropriate.  And the President has been consistent publicly and privately that he doesn’t want to see the war between Israel and Hamas escalate any more than it — than it already has and he doesn’t want to see a broader regional conflict.  And he’s certainly not looking for a war with Iran.  And I am confident that the Prime Minister is aware of the President’s concerns.,Q    Okay.  And on — on Gaza.  This morning, you said that Israel has been doing things the President asked them to do, but we really need to see it sustained over time.,MR. KIRBY:  And you want to know how long is that time.,Q    No, sir.,MR. KIRBY:  Okay.  (Laughter.),Q    That would — that would imply that — you didn’t want to call it an ultimatum, but the — the conditions that the President laid out in his prior phone call with the Prime Minister, that — about the aid workers, the conditions on the ground for humanitarian workers, and aid getting into Gaza — that that needed to change or there could be changes in U.S. policy towards Gaza.,Can you just lay out here whether the President is considering that — you know, that set of circumstances and Israel’s defense against future attacks from nation-states such as Iran to be — to be separate things?  That that — that when you say we need to see it sustained over time, that that — the possibility of policy changes is still a reality separate and apart from the President’s, as he calls it, “ironclad” commitment to Israeli security?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ve said many times that both things are and can be true.  You can be a staunch defender of Israel’s defense.  And we are — and I think he proved that to a fare-thee-well Saturday night — and still be able to have some tough, candid conversations with the way in which they are fighting Hamas inside Gaza.,And those conversations are continuing, and, as I said, hopefully, we’ll get to be able to sit down again with our Israeli counterparts about the — whatever their thinking are — whatever the thinking is about — about Rafah.,So, both things are true; both things can be true.  And — and those are the discussions that we’re having.  You can — you can be a good friend of — of Israel.  In fact, I would argue that only a good friend can do what we did Saturday night and yet still be willing to have tough conversations with the Israeli government about the prosecution of the — of the operations they’re conducting inside Gaza.,Q    So, they’re being considered separate matters?,MR. KIRBY:  I think I’ve answered the question.,Q    Okay.,MR. KIRBY:  Thank you for your patience.  Appreciate it.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No worries.,Q    Thanks, John.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Oh, I don’t know.  Seung Min.  I feel like you guys got all the news of the day.  (Laughs.),Q    Yeah, well, Happy — Happy Tax Day to you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Happy Tax Day.  I did take care of my taxes.  (Laughter.)  I don’t — I don’t have a wife to take care of my taxes.  (Laughter.),Q    Ouch.,Q    Can you — just on the other sort of big news of the day.  Is the — is the President going to be paying any sort of attention or will be briefed on — on the criminal proceedings of former President Trump in New York?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, as you know, the President is pretty busy today.  He has two bilats, as you know, with the — as you just saw, with the Iraqi Prime Minister and one with the Czech Republic.  So, it’s a busy day focusing on, obviously, our national security priorities and continuing the strong alliances that we have with these two leaders — obviously, two separate meetings — and continuing to — you know, continue to deliver for the American people.,I — I’m sure he’ll — he’ll, you know, get an update at some point today, but his focus right now are the meetings that he have — he has and what he continues to do every day.,Q    Right.  And setting aside the fact that the former President is the — is the current President’s general election candidate or challenger for this year, what is the Pre- — what is President Biden, the White House’s reaction to this moment in time?,I mean, it is a historic occasion — “occasion” is an odd word to say — but it — you have a former President going on criminal trial for the first time in history.  So, what is the White House’s reaction to that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I do want to be super mindful, even me commenting on that.  It is an ongoing case.  I just want to be super, super mindful and not comment on an ongoing case, even if it’s asking an opinion about the, you know — the historic nature of what’s happening and what’s going to occur over the next couple of weeks.  So, do want to be mindful.  And he happens to be, as you just said, a candidate — a presidential candidate for 2024, so going to be mindful.,The President is going to continue to focus on — on the week ahead.  He’s going to be traveling, as you all know, to Pennsylvania.  He has two important bilats today.  And it’s always about the American people for this President, and that’s going to be his focus.,Go ahead, Mary.,Q    As you just mentioned, the President is heading to Pennsylvania again this week.  He’s making multiple visits to the state.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    Can you just give us a sense of what we can expect in the coming days?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, it’s a three — coming day or coming —,Q    Days.  (Laughs.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, days.  I didn’t know if you said “weeks.”  I’m like, “Wow, weeks.”,Coming days — it’s a three-day swing to Pennsylvania.  He starts it off tomorrow.  He’s going to start his trip in his hometown of Scranton, where he’ll deliver remarks at — at a campaign event.  So, that’s obviously a campaign event, so they will provide more details.,On Wednesday, he’s going to travel to Pittsburgh, where he’ll deliver remarks again on other pieces of the economic agenda.  So, you can foc- — you can imagine a very strong focus on the economy this week.  And so, we’ll have more on that from us tomorrow on what Wednesday is going to look like.,And then on Thursday, which is, he’ll — obviously, he’ll continue his swing.  He’ll travel to Philadelphia for more campaign events, and certainly the campaign will provide any details on that particular day.,So, it’s Tuesday and Thursday are the campaign priorities, obviously, and they’ll speak to that.  And then there’s an economic focus on Wednesday, and so we’ll have more to share tomorrow on that.,Go ahead.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  So, first of all, with the Iraqi leader here, lawmakers in that country are set to vote on a bill that includes a death penalty or life in prison for same-sex relations.  Would passing such a bill harm U.S. ties?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, you saw the Iraqi Prime Minister and the President have a bilat today, and I think it shows the importance of that alliance and the continued diplomacy engagement that we’ve done — the President continues to do just across the globe, obviously.,The President has been very, very — I think, very vocal about any type of — well, supporting the LGBTQ+ community and has spoken out about any type of humanitarian — or human rights, I should say — any — you know, any human rights violations that we see from here.  And they — we always have those honest conversations with — with leaders, and the President always has, again, those honest conversations.,I’m not going to get into — I’m not going to get ahead of what’s happening currently in Iraq, but we’ve been pretty — we’ve been pretty clear about making sure that human rights — human rights — any human rights violations or if we see anything that is — you know, that — that we think needs — we need to speak to, we do, but I’m just going to be —,Q    And the President will raise that issue today?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — look, the President always raises human rights issues if it warrants with a — with a leader.  I’m going to be really mindful.  We’ll have a readout, obviously, of these two bilats.,I’m — I can’t say for sure that that’s going to come up, but the President has never backed down from having these types of frank, honest conversation and where he stands, and we know where he stands with that community — with LGBTQ+ community.,Q    And then one other topic.  Tesla is laying off more than 10 percent of its global workforce — falling sales and intensive price war for EVs.  Does the ongoing turmoil in the EV market and the very slow consumer transition away from internal combustion engine vehicles make you doubt your full-throated commitment to this space?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look — and I think I’ve talked about this before.  You — look, when it comes to EV, we’ve saw an E- — we’ve seen EV sales, obviously, rise — a record high.  And EVs are more affordable than ever, and I think that’s important.,Last year, EV sales surpassed 1 million for the first time ever, a 50 percent increase.  And under this President, EV sales have more than quadrupled.  Sales of hybrids and EVs are now record high of 18 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales.  Average price of EV is down 20 percent a year ago.,And so, look, the President has always talked about — one of his priorities, as it relates to the economy, is lowering costs.  And we see that with — with these EV sales, obviously, and also creating a — manufacturing jobs in order — if you’re seeing the EV sales go up — right? — you’re going to see a continuation of manufacturing jobs that are needed.  And so, that is important.  We can — we believe it’s going to create jobs.,I can’t speak to Tesla’s decision.  They are a private — obviously, a private company.,But we believe what we’re trying to do and what we’ve been trying — trying to do in last couple of years — whether it’s manufacturing, whether it’s dealing with the climate crisis by making sure EVs are — are available and creating EVs — more EVs and lowering those costs — is working.,And so, that’s what’s going to be the President’s priority.,Go ahead.,Q    House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that he’ll move forward with the vote on additional Israel aid.  If Congress were to pass additional aid for Israel and only that, will President Biden reject it?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’ve been very clear — my colleagues from here just moments ago — that we will not accept a standalone.  A standalone would — would actually not help Israel and Ukraine.  It would actually delay the needs that they — the — the needs that — the needed aid that they obviously need to fight.,When you see what was happening in Ukraine — obviously, the brave people of,Ukrainian,[Ukraine] are fighting against a tyrant.  We need to make sure that they have the assistance that they need.,We saw what happened in Israel just over — over the weekend and the leadership that this President has shown.  It would — it would actually — it would actually not help them if we do a standalone, and we do not support a standalone.,What we want to see is that bipartisan national security supplemental that passed overwhelmingly, 70-29, in the Senate.  And we believe if the — if the Speaker were to put that on the floor, it would pass overwhelmingly.,And so, that’s what we want to see.  The President made clear to the — in that conversation that he had just yesterday with Leader — Leader Schumer, Leader Jeffries, and the Speaker, he was very clear about that.  We need — the Speaker needs to move forward on the bipartis- — on the national security supplemental, which we believe would get a bipartisan — overwhelming bipartisan support.,That’s what we want.  That’s what we have to see.  A standalone, we do not support.,Q    Did the President think that that conversation moved the needle at all?  I mean, this supplemental has been at a standstill in Congress.  So, in that conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson, did he receive any sort of commitment that these two would move together?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, you s- — you heard from Leader — Leader Schumer.  You heard from Leader Jeffries.  They called on the Speaker to move forward.  We saw what happened over the weekend.  We see what happens every day in Ukraine — every day.  And if they want to move qui- — quickly, if they want to do this in an easy way — if the Speaker wants to do this the easiest way pas- — possible, the fastest way possible, there is a — there is a national security supplemental that is waiting, that is ready to be put on the floor.,We know it would get bipartisan support.  We know this.  We’ve heard from Republicans.  We know where Democrats stand.,And so, they have to put this on the — put this on — you know, they’ve got to put this on the floor.  The Speaker has to move quickly — has to move quickly.,Q    On another topic.  The Baltimore bridge crash is now under federal criminal investigation.  Has the President been briefed on that?  And has he been in touch with anyone in the Maryland delegation?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, what I will say is the President is regularly updated on what’s happening in Baltimore.  Obviously, the port, moving forward with that is really important, getting the bridge back up.  As you know, the Department of Transportation, in the early days, announced $60 million to help in that effort.  We’re going to continue to talk with the Maryland delegation of what they need and how much this is going to cost to get that going.,But the President does get regularly updated.  There’s investigation happening, as you just stated.  I’m not going to get in — you know, I’m not going to comment to that.  I’m going to let that independent investigation move forward.,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  Earlier this month, did President Biden tell Xi Jinping to stop supporting Russia’s assault on Ukraine?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m not going to get into diplomatic conversations.  We had a readout of that call that he had about 10 days ago with President Xi.  It was an important call.  It talked — it was a continuation of their summit that they had in San Francisco a couple of months ago.  And so, I’m just not going to get ahead of or go into details about private conversation.  I think the President and we have been very clear.,Q    Okay.  So, the U.S. has announced some sanctions and an executive order to address the support that China has given Russia in those months between the summit and now but also said we are prepared to take further steps.  So, is the administration going to do more to deter Beijing?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, you know, the President certainly is — is — he’s going to underscore — he’s going to continue to underscore the concerns — right? — that he has to China, while also reiterating our readiness to conduct diplo- — diplomacy with North Korea — right?  That’s a part of this too — in our determination to take steps to deter further provocations by the DPRK, obviously.,And also, you know — so, we’re always going to be very clear about that.  You spoke about the executive action.  I’m just going to be super careful about what — what was said between the two leaders.  We did a readout, and we’ve been always very clear — always very clear to speak — to speak very directly about our concerns and underscore our concerns to China.,Q    But just to be clear —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — it came up?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m just going to be really careful.  You have the readout.  I’m going to leave the readout to speak for itself.,Q    Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead, Jared.,Q    Is the White House satisfied with the FISA renewal bill that passed the House and is headed to the Senate?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I think it’s important that it moved out of the House, and now it’s going to go to the Senate.  And we’ve talked about that.  There was a deadline, as you know, and it needs to — we’ve got to get going with the FISA.  It’s really important to get that done.,Q    Some of the changes that the White House is okay with — the reforms —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we’re — we’re — I think we’re — we’re satisfied that it has gone — it is moving.  It’s going to go to the Senate.  We’ll see what happens there.  But it is — we — you’ve heard from us.  You heard from even National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who talked about that the last time he was at the podium.  It’s — it’s important to our national security that we move forward with FISA.  Now it’s in the Senate.,Go ahead, Ed.,Q    Yeah, thanks, Karine.  I want to ask about gas prices.  They’ve been going up: over the last month, 20 cents a gallon.  Is the President considering any new actions, like releasing more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Res- — Reserve?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, don’t have — I don’t have any new actions to read out.,I will say — I will note that gas prices remain well below their peak back in 2022.  I think that’s important.  And the — the average gas price right now is cheaper than this time last year.  And that’s because of what this President has been doing over the last three years, including the SPR.,And, look, let’s not forget: Jobs are up, wages are up, clean energy manufacturing is up — all of these things are incredibly important — because of this President’s historic investment that he has made.,And so — but I would — I think it’s important to note that it remains well below the 2020 peak —,Q    But —,MS.  JEAN-PIERRE:  — 2022 peak, pardon me.,Q    But it’s only three cents lower than a year ago.  It’s up 52 percent from when President Biden came into office.  Any, then, talk about changes in policies that — to encourage the future investment in oil and gas (inaudible)?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the President is committed to lowering costs.  He is.  That is something that you see at the center of every economic policy.  When he’s here giving remarks, he’s talking about lowering costs.  He understands how the American people are still being squeezed.,And so, the reason that it remains below 2022 — the gas prices, as you’re asking me — is because of the historic investment that this President has made.,So, of course, we’re going to continue to monitor and do everything that we can to answer those questions by the American people: What else can we do to lower costs?  But it is important that it is cheaper — it is cheaper to get gas than it was a year ago.  And that’s because of the — of what this President has been doing, because of historic investment that he’s taken.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Is there — to follow up on that, is there any indication that when the President asked for the richest Americans to pay their fair share, that inflation and the rise in gas prices are linked to that request?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Say that one more time.,Q    Do you think that it — the rise in prices of gas and inflation, which is still rising, is linked to the President’s request that the richest Americans pay their fair share?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, what I — here’s what I will say: The way we see the economy is very different than the way Republicans see the economy and how we make sure we have an economy that works for all.  Making sure that the we- — the wealthiest among us — the billionaires and corporations — pay their fair share we believe is the way to go here, not putting that burden on everyday Americans.,That’s an economic policy that we believe in and a policy that br- — builds the economy from the bottom up, middle out, not trickle-down.,And so, we’re going to continue to lower costs.  And we’re going to ask those billionaires and corporations to actually pay their fair share.  That’s something Americans want to see.  That’s something Americans want to see.,As — as it relates to inflation, we look at a trend here, and we have seen inflation moderate over the past several months.  And that’s important, as well, to note.  But, look, we see it very differently.  We want to make sure we’re protecting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, lowering costs.  Republicans don’t want to protect that, and they want to give billionaires and corporations a tax break.  That’s not how we see this.,Q    And to fo- —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, sure.,Q    Quick follow-up.  Earlier, there was reports that the administration released that the Department of Justice — and they haven’t commented on it — may have reached — the courts are reaching out to Julian Assange for a plea deal.  Any update from you guys here as to whether or not there would be a pardon or you would support a plea deal?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s a Department of Justice question.,Q    But — but the President —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That — that is a Department of Justice question.  I ca- — I’m not going to get into it.,Q    And they’re not responding to it, so would you —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer to Department of Justice.,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you.  So, this week, a ton of people will be here for the National Cannabis Policy Summit, and there’s currently still a patchwork of state marijuana laws to regulate the drug safety, including whether there are traces of lead in products.  Since marijuana is still illegal at the federal level but becoming more common at the state level, is the administration doing anything to try to improve safety regulations of products or any consideration of legalizing marijuana moving forward at the federal level?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I will give you a little bit of an update.  So, as you all know, the President asked — asked Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General to initiate the administrative process to review how marijuana is scheduled.  HHS has concluded their independent review, guided by the evidence.  The scheduling review is now with DOJ.  And any input should be certainly directed to them at a time and in a manner they say is appropriate.,So, this is a matter, at this point, once — now that HHS has do- — has completed their review, it’s in Department of Justice, and they can speak to where — where marijuana rescheduling is at this point.,All right.  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead, Jon.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  I’m just wondering, looking backwards, the 2020 election cycle — so, you’re not impacting the upcoming election cycle.,Q    No, no, no.  (Laughter.),Q    Looking backwards —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Let’s see where this is going.,Q    No, you don’t — actually don’t know where it’s going.   (Laughter.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I didn’t say that.  I said, “Let’s see where this is going.”  I have no idea where this is going.  (Laughter.)  I have no clue.,Q    I’m going to help you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — yeah, I know you will.,Q    Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know you will.,Q    In — in 2020, do you think that the American electorate was helped by seeing Donald Trump and Joe Biden on the same stage —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh.,Q    — at the same time —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I knew this was — now I know where this is going.  (Laughter.),Q    — at a presidential debate?  Was that helpful, do you think, in terms of people making that decision?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  You know, that — that’s a question for the American people.  I can’t speak to that from here.  I can’t.,Q    Yeah.  And the — now —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And 2020 was a different time.,Q    Yeah.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It was a different time.,Q    And looking ahead to this upcom- — upcoming election cycle.  Do you think it would be helpful to see these two — (laughter) — candidates who are in a rematch —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So slick.,Q    — on the same stage —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So slick.,Q    — at the same time also competing against each other in a presidential debate?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  As the President would say, you can’t kid a kidder.  (Laughter.),What I will say is that is a question for the campaign.  They will gladly, I’m sure — gladly take — take that question.,All right, everybody.  Thank you so much.,Q    Thanks, Karine.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thanks for your patience.  I know it was a long one.,2:41 P.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington," DC 20500""",15-04-24,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/04/15/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-2/

PDT,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everyone.  (Applause.),Good afternoon, everyone.  Good afternoon.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  Hello, everybody.  We ready to go?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  (Applause.),MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  All right.  Let’s get this started.,So, I first want to thank Attorney General Ford, who is here with us, and Representative Titus for joining us today.  (Applause.),And thank you so much, Madam Vice President.  So, good to see you again.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Good to see you again.  And it’s —,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  So —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — great to be back in Las Vegas.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  Yes.  So, I want to talk about the fact that you travel around this country connecting with communities and young leaders.  And, in fact, just this past fall, you did the “Fight for Our Freedoms” college tour, where I hear you engaged with over 15,000 students on college campuses across the country on the most urgent issues before us — in particular, the fight for our most fundamental freedoms.,One freedom that you’re focused on is the freedom to be safe from gun violence.  And tragically, we know all too well how important this issue is because our communities have faced it firsthand right here in Nevada.,You’ve been a leader on so many issues throughout your career, including this one.  So, it’s no surprise that you were named to oversee the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.  (Applause.)  That deserves claps.,So, my question is: What can we do to end this senseless violence that is harming our communities?  And what is the administration doing to lead on this issue?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  And, Angela, I want to thank you for your leadership.  Moms Demand Action, the work that you — there is Students Demand Action, just the whole group — for years, you all just show up and remind people of the real impact of gun violence in America on parents, on students, on children.  And so, I thank you for your leadership.,Xochitl, it’s so good to see you again.  And thank you for being here and being a part of this —,MS. GOMEZ:  Thank you.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and using your voice in such a courageous way.,And it is wonderful to be back in Nevada and here in Las Vegas.  So, thank you all for being here.,So, you know, I just actually met, before I came on stage, with three students who survived the December shooting at UNLV.  And they’re so courageous, these young leaders.  And their stories, sadly, are the stories of so many young people in our country and the stories that I heard continuously during the college tour.,And their stories reflect a very tragic fact, which is that in America today, the number-one cause of death of our children — the number-one cause of death of the children of America is gun violence — not car accidents, not some form of cancer.  Gun violence.,Today in America, one in five people has a family member that was killed by gun violence.,And, you know, it doesn’t have to be this way.  It doesn’t have to be this way.,During the college tour — and it was — it was universities, it was colleges, it was state colleges, it was trade schools — college-aged young leaders.  And I would ask every — in every room that I went, I would ask, “Please raise your hand” — I’d look at the students, the young people — “Please raise your hand if at any time between kindergarten and 12th grade, you had to endure an active shooter drill.”,In fact, I’ll ask the students right now.  Anybody who’s here, if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade, did you have to endure an active shooter drill?,I’d like the older adults and the press to look at what we’re seeing — the number of hands that go up.,When I would talk with young people — I talked with one particular younger student and — on the subject of active shooter drills, and that student said to me, “Yeah, I — that’s why I don’t like going to fifth period.”  And I said, “Why, sweetheart?  Why don’t you like going to fifth period?”  “Well, because, in that classroom, there’s no closet to hide in.”,The idea that our children and our young people are sitting in a room where they are supposed to be enjoying the wonders of the world and exploring with enthusiasm all that there is to learn and that any part of their mind is also concerned that someone might bust into the classroom — so, this issue is tragic on every level.,I was just recently in Parkland, Florida, and I met with the parents and family members of the victims of that horrendous mass shooting.  I also — they’ve — they’ve preserved the school, the building where it happened.  It’s going to be destroyed soon.  But they’ve — they’ve preserved it in a way that it has stopped at a moment in time.,And so, I walked through the hallways and into the classrooms where that shooting took place, which was maintained as — as basically a crime scene.  And I will — I want to spare anybody here the — the image of what I saw, but I’m not going to, because I think people have to understand the significance of this.,It was a moment frozen in time.  So, there was blood in the hallways.  There were sheets of homework that were spewn around the classrooms, chairs and desks that were upturned.  There wa- — backpacks.  Th- — it happened Valentine’s, and so Valentine’s wishes.,This is what we’re talking about.  And it doesn’t have to be this way.,On this issue, we have within our grasp, within our means things that we can do that can mitigate against, that can reduce the likelihood of these things happening.,I don’t need to tell Nevada this — 1 October, the tragedy of that.  But thankfully, the leaders of Nevada, starting, I would say, with so many of our young leaders — Moms Demand Action and others — pushed for things like safe storage laws, saying we can put in place some smart rules to reduce the likelihood of gun violence.,And let me just be clear: Part of what I think has bogged this situation down and has not allowed for the kind of smart policy that we know can happen is because people, some, are pushing a false choice which suggests you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away.  I’m in favor of the Second Amendment, and I believe we need assault weapon bans.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  Right.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We need background checks — universal background checks.  We need red-flag laws.  (Applause.),But, you know — and then we — one of the things that I announced last week that we’re — we’ve been very proud to do — President Joe Biden, me, and our administration — is to close the gun show loophole.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  Yes.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, I was talking with my team about it, and I said, “You know, I’ve been working on this thing for a long time.”  They said, “What a- — what are you talking about?”  Well, they found the pris- — press clippings, because back in 2007 — I know half this room was not born then.  (Laughter.)  Back in 2007, when I was the elected DA of San Francisco, I was out at the place called the Cow Palace in San Francisco protesting the gun show loopholes.,And so, we’ve — so many of us — have been in this movement for a long time to — to close that loophole, which essentially is this: Gun dealers — registered gun dealers are required to do background checks.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  That’s right.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  But if a gun dealer is — is selling guns at a — let’s call it a flea market or a gun show, they bypass the requirement to do background checks.  And, of course, where do you think the bad guys are going to go to get their guns?  The place where nobody’s going to check into their background.  Right?,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  Right.  Right.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And so, we have finally closed that — that loophole.  And — and I say that to say also that those of us who are in this movement, we do see progress and, therefore, we cannot give up.  We cannot give up.  (Applause.),MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  That’s right.  We absolutely see progress.,Before I ask the next question, I just want to honor survivors that are amongst us —,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  — and those that have been taken from us too soon.  You are the heart and soul of this movement and why we get up and put one foot in front of the other and do this work every single day.  So, thank you so much.,So, Madam Vice President, one important solution for gun violence prevention that doesn’t get enough credit or attention, which you spoke about, is secure firearm storage.  So, Nevada has passed a few secure storage measures into law over the past several years, which shows how communities and advocates and state and local leaders can prevent a tragedy that can strike when guns are not properly stored, whether it’s a child that finds a firearm and hurts themselves or someone else or someone that may take this firearm or steal it to commit a crime.,So, why is secure storage so important for gun safety and gun violence prevention, especially when we are thinking about the young leaders here today?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Secure storage is exactly what it suggests.  It’s about the responsibility that any gun owner should feel and have to secure that gun so that children, young people, those who don’t have the authority to use the gun don’t have access to it.  It’s just — it’s just that basic.,Put it in a lockbox, because — especially if a young person is just curious or, you know, wants to, you know, play with a gun — let’s not make it too easy to get.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  That’s right.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And that’s what secure storage is about.,You know, the — the numbers that I have seen suggest that as many as 75 percent of school shootings resulted from an — from a gun that was not secured.  Tragically, as many as 80 percent of youth suicide is a gun that was not secured.,So, I, again, applaud the leaders of Nevada for saying, “Hey, it’s — you know, just — I’m not saying I’m going to take your gun.  Just, you got a gun; lock it up.”,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  That’s right.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And, also, secure storage includes keeping ammunition separate from the gun, because we also want to just make sure that there would have to be some level of — of thought and reflection that goes into anyone pulling a gun out and thinking about using it.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  That’s right.  Yes.  Thank you so much, Vice President.,MS. GOMEZ:  Madam Vice President, gun violence and so many other things in our lives cause trauma and impact our mental health.  This is especially true for young people like me and I’m sure a lot of the students in this room.  You know, our generation has grown up with active shooter drills and so much more, and I know this firsthand, sad- — sadly.  And I know that you care about this and have brought attention to the issue.,So, I guess I want — want to know: What is the administration doing to help address this and better help and support our mental health?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Xochitl.  We are talking about trauma and a profound amount of trauma that exists in our communities as a result of gun violence, whether it be the trauma that is associated with a child having to go to school and endure active shooter drills and always having on their mind, at some point, being nervous or concerned that their life might be in danger just by going to school.,There’s the trauma associated with parents, who — many will say a silent prayer when they drop their kids off at school that that child will come home at the end of the day safe.,There is the trauma associated with everyday gun violence in America, which far too many communities are experiencing.,And a lot of that trauma goes undiagnosed and untreated.  And as I was — as I do talk with many survivors of gun violence, you know, trauma is — it’s on — it’s a big wound that is invisible to the eye but can be very present.  And we got to help people find productive ways of healing.,And so, mental health is about recognizing that the body doesn’t just start from the neck down when we talk about healthcare; there’s also the healthcare we need from the neck up, and that’s mental health care.,And so, the work that we’ve been doing as an administration is to deal with this on a number of levels, and one is that in our Bipartisan Safe Communities Act that we got passed — the first meaningful gun safety legislation in 30 years, that President Biden and are proud that we could get passed with bipartisan support, which (inaudible) —,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  That deserves applause.  (Applause.),THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  (Laughter.),And so, part of what we did there is we put a billion dollars into getting resources to public and — and — schools — to public schools to hire mental health counselors in public schools.,But to the point of even just talking with the — the young leaders that I just spoke with from UNLV, we still have so much more work to do to make sure that mental health services are available to meet the demand.,One of the things I love about Gen Z — and I love many things about Gen Z — your generation is willing to talk about mental health and the need for support.  You know, older generations still kind of have a stigma about it.  Younger generations are so much smarter on this subject, which is they want to talk about it.  But when they talk about it, we — those of us who are in a position to do something about it — got to make sure the resources are there for them.,And so, there is still a lot more work to be done.  But it makes a difference, because it is about healing.  It’s about creating safe spaces where people can talk about their fears and not feel that they’re being judged.  And that’s very important.,Everyone, I believe, has a right to feel and be safe.  And there are many ways we will get there, and one of them is to make sure people have the support they need to deal with the emotional impact of this.  Yeah.,MS. GOMEZ:  That’s — yeah.  (Applause.),MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  Yes, claps.,MS. GOMEZ:  Madam Vice President, you are an inspiration.  You know, personally — I’m sure like a lot of us here in this room — I look up to you.  You know, this room is full of passionate young leaders, and you have called on us to take charge.,So, I guess, I — we — we’d like to know: What advice would you like to leave us with today?,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I’ve got plenty of advice.  How much time do you have?  (Laughter.),MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  Let’s hear it.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me start with a — a challenge that I would issue, and I did it — I started it during the college tour.  But for all the young leaders here who are thinking about your life and your — your role of leadership as you go on in life, I’m going to challenge you to consider a profession in the mental health — the mental health professions, of which there are many.,But do think about that, because one of the most effective ways that we offer mental health is to do it based on peer support, which is people who have gone through something are usually best equipped to help people who are going through that thing.  And so, I would challenge you then.,Okay.  So, let’s see.  Let me start with this: Never allow yourself to be limited by other people’s limited ability to imagine who can do what.  Do you understand what I’m saying?  I see everybody nodding over there.  (Laughter.)  You know what I’m saying.,Don’t ever listen to people who look at you and say, “Ah, you’re too young.”  “Ah, nobody like you has ever done that before.”  “Ah, wait, your turn.”  “Ah, it’s going to be so much work.”,Don’t you listen to that.  Don’t you ever listen to that.,I like to say I eat “no” for breakfast.  (Laughter.)  I don’t hear “no” until maybe it’s spoken the 10th time.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  I’m going to use that now.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I eat “no” for breakfast.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  I’m going to use that.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Remember your power right now.  You know, there’s something that’s been happening in our country over the last several years that I think is so unfortunate and — and very upside down, which is that some would suggest that the measure of your strength is based on who you beat down, instead of understanding the true measure of an individual’s strength, I believe, is based on who you lift up.  It — (applause) — right?  Truly.,And if you ever question your strength as an individual, see what happens when you help someone — just one person — with anything and what that does for them.  That’s your strength, and it’s a superpower.  It’s a superpower to have some level of concern and consideration for the well-being of other people and then take it upon yourself to do something about that.,More advice?  Okay, yes.  (Laughter.),Don’t you ever let anybody tell you who you are.  You tell them who you are.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  That’s right.  (Applause.),THE VICE PRESIDENT:  A piece of advice my mother gave me: You may be the first to do many things; make sure you’re not the last.  Okay?  (Applause.)  Okay.,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  I hope you’re taking notes, y’all.  I hope you’re taking notes.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, I think I’m going to end with that one.  (Laughter.)  I could keep rolling.,But — but, you know, dream with ambition.  I say, to each one of you, dream with ambition.  Ambition is a good thing.  It’s good to believe that you can do something and then go for it.  Go for it, and know that you will have a community of people — sometimes you don’t see them, but you got to know it — that will applaud you as you go out there and go for it.,You know, and — and remember that there may be many times where you might be the only one in a room — be it a boardroom, a meeting room — who looks like you or who has had your life experience.  But I want all the young people to look around this auditorium to know that we will all be in that room with you.,So, never feel alone in a way that allows a circumstance to make you feel small.  Know that you have a community of people who applaud your ambition and want you to go out there and go for it.  Okay?,Always remember that —,MS. FERRELL-ZABALA:  Thank you so much.,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — because our country will be the better for all that you guys do.,So, there we go.  That’s it.  Enough of that.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.),MS.

While the Biden-Harris Administration has made $750 million in federal funding available to implement state crisis intervention programs –which includes red flag programs – much of this funding remains unused. Of the 21 states that currently have passed red flag laws, only six are using BSCA funding to implement them.,During the virtual event, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials along with state and local government leaders and gun violence prevention experts highlighted the impact BSCA funding can have on the implementation of red flag laws across the country and encouraged other states to take up the Vice President’s call, in order to protect their communities and save lives.,Office of Gun Violence Prevention Director Stefanie Feldman, Deputy Director Rob Wilcox and Deputy Director Greg Jackson were joined by Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Executive Director Delrice Adams, Illinois Criminal Justice Information Technical Director Maureen Brennan, Brady Chief Programs and Policy Officer Christian Heyne, Ad Council Vice President Allison Baum, Illinois Department of Public Health Deputy Director Lauri Sanders, Illinois Department of Public Health Chief Operating Officer Shannon Lightner, and San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott.,Today’s convening comes on the heels of the,Biden-Harris Administration announcing a new rule,that will save lives by reducing the number of firearms sold without background checks. This action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s strategy to stem the flow of illegally acquired firearms into our communities and hold accountable those who supply the firearms used in crime.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",15-04-24,Readout of the White House Convening on Implementing Red Flag Laws,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/15/readout-of-the-white-house-convening-on-implementing-red-flag-laws/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDT,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Can we hear it for Joi?  (Applause.),Hi, everyone.  Please have a seat.  Have a seat.,Joi, you are — and I — and I got to meet that baby girl of yours.  Oh, my god, she’s precious.  To you and your husband and to your family, I thank you for your courage and your willingness to share your story.,And to everyone here, I thank you for your leadership and your work and all that you are doing on behalf of so many people who deserve to be seen, deserve to be heard, and whose voices are so important about what this issue means.,I want to thank the leaders who are here.  I don’t want to miss anybody.  I hope I don’t.  But I do know that Arizona Senator Burch is here.  Where are you?   Hi.  There you are.  (Applause.)  We were just together on Friday in Tucson.,I’m — you know, again, if I could just take a moment to say that I have met some extraordinary people over the course of these last two years, who have been willing to share something that is so personal and would otherwise be very private — it’s their business — it’s not everybody’s business; it’s their business — and, because of what has happened, have decided to share your stories because you know how many other people are being affected who may not have the ability to stand before a microphone and the press and talk about these things.,And that takes a lot, because you’re going through your own experience and you’re sharing it with perfect strangers.  And so, I want to thank you guys.,And there’s so many other people who, over the course of these last two years, have been sharing their story so that we understand this is not about politics, this is not about ideology.  This is about the fact that far too many people are suffering and should not have to.,So, thank you guys.  And thank you again to Senator Burch.  (Applause.),Congresswoman Dina Titus, I thank you always for your leadership in this beautiful state of Nevada.  (Applause.)  Nevada State Party Chair Daniele — where is she? — thank you very much — Monroe-Moreno.  (Applause.),My dear friend, the Attorney General, General Ford, I thank you — (applause) — for fighting for justice every day and fighting for the — the spirit behind the principles that were the foundation for our country and are enshrined in the Constitution of the United States.  I thank you for your work.,And then Senator Jacky Rosen could not be here, but let’s get her reelected, please, to the United States Senate.  (Applause.),So, I was in Tucson on Friday, and we talked about it, and I’m going to just share a little bit about what is obvious to everyone here.  Freedom is fundamental to the promise of America.  When we talk about the promise of America, foundationally, we believe in freedom.  We know that the strength of our nation has been a function of many things, including our commitment to the expansion of rights.,But for the first time in a very long time, we are seeing a full-on attent — intent to restrict rights, to take rights.,We just witnessed the highest court in our land, almost two years ago — the court of Thurgood and RBG — take a constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America.,And thereafter, in state after state, laws being proposed and passed that would criminalize healthcare providers — I mean, literally laws that are providing for prison time for doctors and nurses — in Texas, for life — laws that would punish women, laws that are meant to judge and make people feel as though they’ve done something wrong and as though they are alone and should be embarrassed, laws that are immoral.,An example being those that make no exception even for rape or incest, which means you are telling a survivor of a crime — a violation to their body — violence to their body — that they don’t have the right to determine what happens to their body next.  Immoral.,So, we are here to say that we’re not going to stand for this.  It is not okay, and we are prepared to organize and to take to the streets and to knock on doors and to text folks and to let everyone know their power at this moment to protect the rights of the people of our country.,And so, I wanted to stop by here to thank, in particular, the organizers and volunteers that are doing this work in preparation for the ballot initiative coming up in November here in Nevada.  (Applause.),And, look, they’re holding up their clipboards.  Exactly.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.),And you guys are making such a difference, because it is also about reminding folks that we’re all in this together and reminding folks it doesn’t have to be this way.  It doesn’t have to be this way.,But, you know, the thing about a democracy that is founded on the notion of individual rights and liberties and freedoms is that we got to fight and be vigilant to maintain those rights and freedoms.  Right?,You know, the nature of democracy is such that it’s really — there’s a duality to it.  When a democracy is intact, oh, the strength — the strength that it invests in its people, in protection of their individual rights and liberties and freedoms — the strength it gives its people.  And it is very fragile.  A democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it.  (Applause.),And that’s what you all are doing.  That’s what — and that’s what we’re doing together.  That’s what we’re doing together.,AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And we are going to win across — we’re going to win this ballot initiative.  And Joe Biden and I are going back to the White House.,But let me just tell you — (applause) — and here’s the thing about this election in terms of that point about the White House and who sits in those seats — I know that the speakers mentioned it earlier.  On this issue of — of the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body, the right to have access to reproductive healthcare, the right to have that autonomy and that authority and not have it be taken from their government, not having people who sit up in a — in a statehouse telling people what they’re supposed to do and what is in their best interest as though the women of America don’t know what is in their own best interest — on the issue of this subject and then the upcoming election, let us be clear: There is a direct track between what we have seen in states like Arizona, what the people of Nevada are fighting for, and who the previous president was.,Let’s not forget, Donald Trump made clear his intention to select three members of the United States Supreme Court so that they would overturn the protections of Roe v. Wade.  It was his stated intention, and they did as he intended.,And you all — many of you may remember, I was in the United States Senate at the time and served on the Judiciary Committee and would raise the subject.  Sadly, a lot of us could see what was going to come, and exactly what we feared happened because there was a president who has the power to select members of the United States Supreme Court who intended to undo these protections.,Let’s be clear, then, that when he sits back and most recently says, “Well, I believe that the states should make these decisions,” he says — right?  Okay.  So, you believe that the states have a right to reinstate laws from the 1800s to criminalize healthcare providers, to provide up to prison for life, no exception for crimes of violence to someone’s body.,So, let’s all be clear: What we are seeing in these states that we are talking about are Trump abortion bans, and he can’t get away from that.  Those are Trump abortion bans.,And this election is about many, many important issues, including the ability of the people to organize in support of what we believe to be foundational values and principles about who we are as America.,And when we look at our power, let’s not forget the power of the people, and let’s not overlook the momentum we’ve already achieved.  I’ll remind us: When this issue has been on the ballot —,(A child in the audience cries.),Yes, my love.  (Laughter.),When this issue has been on the ballot — from Kentucky to California, from Virginia to Ohio, when this issue has been on the ballot, the voters voted in favor of freedoms — in red state and blue — making clear, by the way, this is not a partisan issue — making clear there is a consensus among the American people that it is wrong to take rights from the people of our country.,So, momentum is on our side.  We have 205 days until the election.  Yes, I am counting.  (Laughter.),And I do believe that the work that we are doing and are committed to doing — because you’re here — over these next 205 days is not only important, but it’s — it’s fun.  (Laughs.),Isn’t it fun to work on a campaign?  (Applause.)  Isn’t it fun to meet people you may not have otherwise ever met before who all come together in a place like this, who are all carrying those — those boards, just working together because we believe in each other and we know the power that we have, especially when we come together?,And so, I just want to leave everyone with this thought, which is there is so much good in our country and in the world, but we can’t take anything for granted.,And this is an extraordinary group of leaders who are doing this work here in this beautiful state of Nevada, who are going to have an impact, for the most part, on people that you may never meet, people who may never know your name, but who are forever going to be benefited because of the work that you all are doing.  (Applause.),And so, I came by to thank you for all that you are doing in defense of our country and each other.  And let’s just carry on.  And we’re going to take this to November.,And we’re going to reelect Jacky Rosen to the United States Senate.  (Applause.)  And we’re going to get this ballot measure passed.  And we’re going to reelect Joe Biden as President of the United States, and I’m going to head back too.  (Applause.),Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.),END                     2:56 P.M.

to have you both here as we begin this new era of a partnership.,As you’ve heard me say before, a great deal of history in our world will be written in the Indo-Pacific over the coming years and the

an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, prosperous, and secure for all.,This afternoon, we’ll discuss a few key areas where our nations are deepening ties.  First, technology and clean energy.  We’re securing our semiconductor supply chain — from securing our semiconductor supply chain, to expanding trusted telecommunications in the Philippines, to building a clean energy workforce, to expanding our cooperation across the entire board.,Second, we are deepening our maritime and security ties.  This is something I know you’ve discussed with Vice President Harris during her travel to the Indo-Pacific.  And I want to be clear: The United States — The United States’ defense commitments to Japan and to the Philippines are ironclad.  They’re ironclad.,As I’ve said before, any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels, or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our Mutual Defense Treaty.,Finally, I’m proud to announce we’re launching an economic corridor in the Philippines as part of the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.  This is the first corridor in the Indo-Pacific.  It means more jobs for people across the entire region.  It means more

national security advisors, and our vice ministers, as well as the conduct of trilateral maritime exercises and joint development cooperation.,But this meeting can be just a beginning.,Facing the

This latest round of debt cancellation comes on the heels of President Biden announcing new plans that, if implemented, would cancel student debt for over 30 million Americans when combined with actions the Administration has taken over the last three years. This week’s announcements reinforce the President’s commitment to using every path available to deliver student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible through various actions.,The 277,000 Americans receiving this latest round of debt relief are borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan, other borrowers enrolled in Income-Driven Repayment plans, and borrowers receiving Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Biden-Harris Administration fixed Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) and launched the SAVE Plan last year – the most affordable repayment plan ever. Already 8 million borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, 4.5 million of those borrowers have a monthly payment of $0, and over 1 million additional borrowers have a monthly payment of less than $100. And if borrowers took out low balances of loans, the SAVE Plan puts them on a faster path to debt relief after at least ten years of payments.,Since President Biden took office, his Administration has approved over $54 billion in debt cancellation for 1.3 million borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, including the new SAVE Plan. This builds on additional actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to cancel debt for nearly 900,000 public service workers, 1.3 million borrowers cheated by their schools or borrowers covered by related court settlements, and nearly 550,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability, including many veterans.,While the Administration continues to cancel Americans’ student debt through improving existing forgiveness programs and through the SAVE Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is also pursuing new plans that, if implemented, would cancel student debt for tens of millions more.

These 277,000 borrowers are enrolled in my Administration’s SAVE Plan, or were approved for relief because of fixes we made to Income-Driven Repayment Plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness.,Today’s announcement comes on top of the significant progress we’ve made for students and borrowers over the past three years. That includes: providing the largest increases to the maximum Pell Grant in over a decade; fixing Public Service Loan Forgiveness so teachers, nurses, police officers, and other public service workers get the relief they are entitled to under the law, and holding colleges accountable for taking advantage of students and families.   And, earlier this week, I laid out my Administration’s new plans that would cancel student debt for more than 30 million Americans when combined with everything we’ve done so far.,From day one of my Administration, I promised to fight to ensure higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Under President Biden’s leadership, the home appraisal gap—an indicator of potential racial and ethnic bias—has shrunk by more than 40%,80% of Congressional Republicans are supporting a plan that would reverse this progress, while cutting Medicare, Social Security, and the Affordable Care Act,Nearly three years ago at a,speech to commemorate the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre,, President Biden committed to addressing racial inequities in the home appraisal process and increase the share of federal contract spending awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by 50%. Today, during remarks at the National Action Network Convention, President Biden will highlight how his Administration is delivering on that promise and announce key progress being made to create opportunity in historically under-resourced communities and narrow the racial wealth gap.,While the President and Vice President continue working to close the racial wealth gap and create more opportunities for all Americans, 80% of Congressional Republicans are supporting a plan that would move the country backwards.  Their plan would defund the President’s executive orders on racial equity, while cutting Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and Social Security—raising the Social Security retirement age in the process. Congressional Republicans would also roll back billions of dollars in investments and tax incentives that support small businesses as they shift to a clean economy.  Moreover, the Congressional Republican plan would also increase prescription drug, energy, and housing costs, while fighting for tax giveaways for the very rich and big corporations.,In direct contrast, closing the racial wealth gap has been central to the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic agenda, and the progress we are making under the President’s leadership is delivering for communities nationwide, including Black Americans. The President’s announcements today to build on this progress include:,Rooting out bias in the home appraisal process.,The Federal Housing Finance Agency is releasing,new data,showing that the “appraisal gap”—the likelihood that homes in communities of color are undervalued compared to homes in majority-white communities—has been cut by more than 40% since the Biden-Harris Administration took action on appraisal bias. The data also show that some states have eliminated the gap entirely. In these states, families in communities of color are no more likely to have their home valued at less than the agreed contract price than are families in white communities. This means that more Black Americans and people of color are able to build greater wealth from owning a home.,While there can be many reasons why an individual home is valued below the agreed-upon contract price, systemic undervaluation in communities of color can indicate racial bias in the appraisal process.,On June 1, 2021, the,centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre,, President Biden announced the creation of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE): a,first-of-its-kind effort,to root out bias and advance equity in the home appraisal process. Since releasing the,PAVE Action Plan,in March 2022, the Task Force has made,critical progress,towards implementation, including major steps to empower consumers to take action against appraisal bias; prevent algorithmic bias in home valuation; and support a well-trained and more representative appraiser profession.,Rooting out bias in appraisals can help narrow the racial wealth gap. According to a,recent study,, eliminating racial disparities in the amount of wealth families gain from owning a home would narrow the wealth gap by 16% between Black and white households and by 41% between Latino and white households.,Achieving record federal investment in small disadvantaged businesses.,Today, President Biden is also announcing that in Fiscal Year 2023, agencies surpassed the President’s goal for federal contracting dollars going to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), awarding SDBs a record-breaking $76.2 billion, or 12.1% in federal contracts. This sets a new all-time record for federal dollars to SDBs, surpassing the record set by the Biden-Harris Administration last year of $69.9 billion, and illustrates continued progress towards the President’s goal of 15% to SDBs by 2025. Three consecutive years of record-breaking awards to SDBs underscores the Administration’s unwavering commitment to leveling the playing field for the Nation’s small businesses and ensuring that no talent is left on the sidelines, even in the face of legal attacks that seek to undercut the Administration’s efforts.,Increasing federal investments in under-resourced businesses not only helps more Americans realize their entrepreneurial dreams and strengthens the supplier base, but also narrows persistent wealth disparities. According to,analysis,from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, eliminating racial disparities in business ownership rates would narrow the wealth gap by an additional 22% between Black and white households and by an additional 17% between Latino and white households. Recognizing this historic opportunity, in 2021, the President set a bold goal of increasing the share of the more than $630 billion in contracting dollars going to SDBs each year, including Black, Latino and Asian American-owned small businesses, to 15% by 2025—or an increase of 50% from 2010.,Canceling student loan debt.,The Biden-Harris Administration also today announced that it is canceling an additional $7.4 billion in student loan debt for 277,000 borrowers. This brings the total amount of debt relief approved by the Administration to $153 billion for 4.3 million Americans. Today’s announcement builds on the,President’s announcement earlier this week,, laying out his Administration’s plans that would cancel student debt for tens of millions of Americans, if implemented as proposed. These plans would cancel runaway interest for over 25 million borrowers, cancel loan debt for borrowers eligible for forgiveness programs but not enrolled in those programs, and cancel student debt for borrowers experiencing hardship in their daily lives preventing them from paying back their loans.,Black and Latino borrowers are more likely to experience growth in their student loan balances due to excessive interest accumulation. Four years after graduation, Black bachelor’s degree borrowers, on average, owe more than they borrowed. These plans would not only help create more financial stability for millions of working and middle-class families, they would also help address the disproportionate debt burden on communities of color and advance racial equity.,Today’s announcements build on the progress the President has made to leverage the full force of the Federal Government—including with the signing of two executive orders on advancing racial equity—in order to ensure the promise of America for all communities, including Black Americans. Here are just a few examples of how Bidenomics and the President’s Investing in America agenda are already delivering for Black Americans:,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",12-04-24,FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces Key Progress on Efforts to Close the Racial Wealth Gap,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-key-progress-on-efforts-to-close-the-racial-wealth-gap/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

election subversion; ripping away reproductive freedom; getting affirmative action — gutting it and attacking diversity across American life; banning books — this is 2024 — banning books, attempting to erase history;

JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  All right.  Great.,So, from Buffalo — from Buffalo and Kansas City to Uvalde and Monterey Park, we have seen the epidemic of gun violence tearing apart communities nationwide, leaving empty seats at dining room tables across the country.,The President and the Vice President have spent countless hours with families who have lost loved ones to this senseless violence, and they all say the same thing: Do something.,These same families and other survivors of gun violence turned their pain into purpose.  They organized, demanded action, and marched for their lives.,And thanks to their collective efforts, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years.,Today, we are building on that progress and announcing a new rule that saves lives by requiring background checks for all gun dealers engaged in the business of firearm — firearms dealing, including for guns sold at gun shows and online.,This new rule implements the only significant expansion of background check requirements since then-Senator Biden helped shepherd the Brady Bill over the finish line in 1993.,Today’s new action furthers the Biden-Harris administration’s historic efforts to stop the illegal flow of guns and hold those who supply firearms used in crime accountable.  But there is still much work to be done.,President Biden and Vice President Harris continue to call on Congress to enact universal background checks and finish the job.,Now, as you all have reported, overnight Russia launched another lon- — loun- — large round of aerial assaults against Ukraine’s energy grid, as Vladimir Putin continue[s] to try to break the spirit — the spirit of the Ukrainian people and plunge them into darkness.,Russia struck the largest power plant in Kyiv Oblast, as well as power facilities in five other regions across Ukraine.,As President Zele- — Zelenskyy said in the recent days, Ukraine needs more air defenses and interceptors to protect its people and critical infrastructure against Russian missiles and Ir- — Iranian-supplied drones.,We need the House of Republic- — House of Rep- — Representatives — Republicans specifically, obviously, but the House of Repre- — Representatives — to take urgent action to pass the bipartisan national security supplemental bill so we can send Ukraine more air defenses.,And let me correct myself.  It’s actually the House of Representatives.  We need Speaker — the Speaker to put that bill on — on the floor because we know we would get overwhelming support on — from Republicans and Democrats, obviously.  So, we need to see that bill put on the floor that was passed overwhelmingly in the Senate.,The strikes in Ukraine over the past 24 hours are another terrible reminder that Ukraine’s need is critical.,And now, turning over to Gaza, I wanted to provide an update on our efforts to do all we can to increase the amount of humanitarian assistance reaching Gaza and ease the humanitarian suffering.,As you know, when President Biden last spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu just last week, he was clear that Israel must announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, measurable steps to address humanitarian suffering.,The past few days have shown some pra- — some promise.  Israel made the commitment to open the Ashdod Port for the direct delivery of assistance into Gaza, to open a new crossing for a new route for assistance to reach North Gaza, and to significantly increase deliveries from Jordan directly into Gaza.,And over the past few days, over 1,000 trucks loaded with humanitarian aid have gotten into Gaza and with over 300 trucks going into Gaza yesterday — just yesterday alone.,That’s good progress, but it’s still not enough. And we hope to see the progress continue and accelerate.,This afternoon, President Biden will welcome President Marcos of the Philippines to the White House for his second meeting at the White House in as many years.  I know the National Security Advisor — Nat- — Jake Sullivan spoke to this on Monday, but I will reiterate what he laid out as well, which is that the President later will host the first-ever trilateral leaders’ summit between the United States, Japan, and Philippines.,During President Biden’s meeting with President Marcos, the two presidents will mark the unprecedented strength of the alliance between the United States and the Philippines.  The leaders will discuss initiatives to enhance economic and energy security, bolster maritime cooperation, invest in critical infrastructure, and deepen people-to-people ties.  And President Biden will reinforce the ironclad U.S. alliance commitments to the Philippines.,Following the meeting, the President will host the historic trilateral leaders’ summit.  As — as leading maritime democracies, the United States, Japan, and the Philippines share a joint vision for the future of the Indo-Pacific.  And with this — with this leader-level trilateral, we are — we are taking our cooperation to new heights.,Our national security advisors met in Tokyo last June to initiate our trilateral cooperation, and officials from across our three governments have met on topics as varied as economic security and maritime cooperation.,Today, the leaders will announce new initiatives to accelerate and surge high-quality infrastructure investments in the Philippines, enhance energy — energy security, deepen maritime cooperation, and strengthen partnerships on technology and cybersecurity.,Our three countries embark on this new era of trilateral cooperation as trusted equal partners, guided by shared values and an unwavering commitment to a free, open, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.,With that, Darlene, it’s good to see you.,Q    Good to see you too.  Thank you.  To jump off of what you were saying in your topper about Gaza, the USAID Administrator, Samantha Power, has said that she accepts as credible reports that famine is already underway in Northern Gaza.  Does the President and the White House share that assessment?  And if so, you know, you were talking about the progress —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — is good, but more needs to be done.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Exactly.,Q    What more can be done?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Exactly.  The progress is good.  More needs to be done.  I talked about the commitment that Israel had — the Prime Minister gave to the — to the President just last week, and we talked ab- — I talked about the port, and I talked about the new border crossings in Northern Gaza.  We need to see that open up, that move forward.,But we’ve seen some progress — right? — the opening of more routes and also more trucks.  As I just laid out, we’ve seen more than 1,000 trucks in the last three days.,Look, specifically to Samantha Power and her comments, our an- — understanding is that the latest reporting from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification indicates that the famine is imminent in Gaza.  And that’s why we’re trying to do everything that we can to uptick, obviously, the humanitarian aid.,We know how dire the situation is in Gaza.  So, we are certainly deeply concerned about these reports.  And so, we’ve been working around the clock — around the clock to get more of that aid into Gaza.  And so, we’re going to continue to do this.  We’re going to continue to push Israel to increase the flow that is getting into Gaza.,And like I said, we — I’ve laid out their commitments.  There are two other ways that we want to see their commitment continue, which is that port that I just mentioned at the top and just moments ago, and — and so, also those — the routes — the routes in — in Northern Gaza.,So, there is more work to be done.  But, again, a thousand trucks over the last three days is an improvement.  It’s good promise.  We need to see more.,Q    Second, was there any reaction from the President to O.J. Simpson’s death?  Do you know if they ever crossed paths?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —,Q    If so, how?  When?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll say this.  Our thoughts are with — with his families during this difficult time — obviously, with his family and loved ones.  And I’ll say this — I know that they have asked for some privacy, and so we’re going to respect that.  I’ll just leave it there.,Go ahead.,Q    Thanks.  Iran is threatening a significant attack against Israel.  With all of the U.S. assets in the region, will the U.S. provide assistance in thwarting this attack?  How is the U.S. preparing to respond?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, you heard from the President directly yesterday.  He mentioned this at the top of his press conference and laid out our concerns, certainly, about these threats that are being made.  And he made very clear as well that America’s support for Israel’s security is ironclad, especially against these threats against — that’s coming from Iran and their proxies.,And so, the President made that clear as well when he spoke to,President,[Prime Minister] Netanyahu just last week.  As I mentioned moments ago, I want to be really careful.  I’m not going to get into operational procedures from here.,Beyond that, we’ve made ourselves very, very clear.  The President made himself very clear just yesterday.  And so, just don’t have anything else to add beyond that.,Q    But we certainly have done joint strikes against Iranian proxies in the recent weeks and months.  Should we be braced for joint strikes against — in response to an Iranian strike against Israel?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I want to be super mindful.  I don’t want to get into hypotheticals here.  What we have made very clear — obviously, we’ve seen the threats coming from Iran.  And so, we have made ourselves very clear where we stand in supporting Israel’s security.  That is ironclad.  Does no- — that does not change.  I’m just not going to get into — into details about our operational procedures from here.,Q    Just one more on this.  General Kurilla is in the Middle East.  He’s making a stop in Israel.  He’s reportedly there to help, you know, coordinate with Israel ahead of this expected attack.  What does that coordination look like?  What does — what does that mean exactly?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I will refer you to CENTCOM.,Go ahead, Jeff.,Q    Karine, just to follow up on that topic.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    Has Iran been in touch via intermediaries with Washington to indicate that when it responds to Israel’s attack on — on its embassy — on its Syrian Embassy that it will not escalate?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, obviously, we don’t want this conflict to spread.  We’ve been very clear about that.  And we’ve been very clear that in — you know, to Iran that we’re not involved in the Damascus strike.  Right?  We’ve been also very clear.,I’m not going to get into public back-and-forth.  We communicated to Iran that the U.S. had no involvement in the strike, as I just mentioned, that happened in Damascus.  And we warned Iran not to use this attack as a pretext to escalate further in the region or attack U.S. facilities or person- — personnel.,I’m going to be super mindful not to — to speak beyond that from here or elaborate further.  But we’ve been very clear.,Q    Can you say whether Iran has responded to your or the U.S.’s indications?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just not going to get into public back-and-forth from here.,Q    And following up on something that the President said yesterday with regard to Julian Assange.  He indicated that the U.S. is considering a deal.  To what extent does the White House and the President weigh in with DOJ on this, considering that it’s a DOJ-led run — or a DOJ-led issue?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, from here, from the podium, I’m not going to go beyond what the President said.  I’m going to refer you to the Department of Justice.  I’m just going to be super mindful from the podium from here.,Q    But he weighed in.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know.  I’m — I’m going to be super mindful from the podium.  I’m just not going to go beyond what the President — the President sa- — shared yesterday.  I would refer you to the Department of Justice.,Go ahead.,Q    I have questions on two topics, Karine.  First on abortion.  Vice President Harris is going to Arizona tomorrow to talk about the need for abortion access in the state.  I know the President’s own views on this topic have been evolving over the recent decades.  Should we expect him to be talking in public about this issue?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So — so, want to be super mindful.  Tomorrow’s event is a — is a campaign event.  So, going to let the campaign speak to the Vice President’s engagement.,Q    Is tomorrow a campaign event?  I thought it became official.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  From what I understand, it’s a campaign event.,Q    Okay.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I would refer you to her team, at least — at the le- — at the least.  But from my understanding, it’s a campaign event.  So, I’ll leave that there.,But, you know, the President spoke to this.  He was shouted a question about — about what occurred in Arizona, how devastating and how wrong the decision to go back to 1864 to make it more difficult for women — millions of women.,And, you know, he — he talked about that.  So, I certainly will — will refer you to his comments.,The President has consistently been very clear about where he stands.  He stands for women’s rights.  He stands for women to be able to make decisions about their bodies, right?  He — he stands for reproductive freedom.  He put a statement out right after Arizona made their decision.,So, he’s been very — you know, very steadfast and out front on this.  You’re going to hear from the Vice President.  So, you’ll hear directly from her.  We’ve been really clear.  And all of this — what we’re seeing right now in states — we have 21 states that have some se- — that have extreme bans — 21 states across the country.,And a lot of — and that has been caused by the chaos that we have seen from the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  And that’s because, obviously, of the Dobbs decision.  It was a — it was a constitutional right for almost 50 years, and that has been taken away from women.,And so, it’s caused chaos.  And we’re going to continue to call that out.  We should be fighting for women’s rights, women’s freedom, Americans’ freedom.  And that’s not what — that’s not where Republicans are.,Q    I know other colleagues have questions.  But I also just want to ask about the State Dinner, because regulators in the Biden administration have sued both Amazon and Apple alleging anticompetitive behavior that has caused public harm.  So, why were executives from those companies invited to the dinner last?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, when it comes to the State Dinner, we invite an array of folks to come in.  And — and obviously, you know, it’s — it’s an important night of — especially when another country comes, it shows bipartisanship.  It shows the strength of that alliance that the U.S. has with that particular country.  The — the list varies, you know, and it — we — it’s always — it’s always different types of people that come to — to the —,Q    But the Justice Department said, just —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — less than a month ago, that Apple uses its control —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — over the iPhone to engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — saying that that lawsuit should send a strong signal to other companies.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And —,Q    So, what signal is the White House sending?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I hear your question.  That’s the Department of Justice to decide.  I do not —,Q    But the White House choose —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, I —,Q    — who to invite to the dinner.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I — no, I’m not saying that the DOJ invited — invited people to the White House state dinner.  That’s not what I’m saying.  I’m saying DOJ moved forward with that particular case — that particular lega- — legal action.  I can’t speak to that.,We always invite an array of — of people.  We bring people from all corners of different industries here to the White House.  That’s what we do.  And I just don’t have anything else further to share.  And we — you know, I think it’s important that — that we do that, but I can’t speak to a DOJ legal case.  They took —,Q    So, the President doesn’t think that those companies did —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I —,Q    — anything wrong?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That is a legal action being taken by the Department of Justice.  I can’t speak to that.  They have their reasons of moving forward on that.  I — I can’t speak to that.,We invite a — a diverse group of people when it comes to events — not just state dinners — when it comes to events here — from even different sides of the — of the aisle.  That’s what — that’s what this President has done.,I — I can’t speak to what DOJ — and their legal action.  I just can’t speak to that from here.,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  Picking up on abortion.  When the President was asked yesterday what his message was to the people of Arizona in light of the ruling, he said, “Elect me.”  So, can you elaborate on what —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — he meant by that?  What can he do for those people?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  I — I’m going to be careful because obviously he was talking about 2024.  I mean, look —,Q    Actually, he was talking about the 20th century, as I recall.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, okay.,So, this extreme abortion ban, as we know, that we see was made possible because of the Supreme Court.  And we know what the last previous President said.  He said that, you know, he would — he would make sure that Roe v. Wade was no longer constitutional law, and he made that happen and — which has led to — to chaos — to chaos across the board.,And so, I want to be careful for — for, you know, talking about an upcoming election, so I’m not going to speak to that from here.,But we have seen what’s happened in last almost two years since Roe v. Wade has been overturned.  We’ve seen women having to be turned away from emergency rooms, not being given lifesaving — lifesaving needs that they — they have to get in order to — for their lives to be protected.  That’s been turned away.,And so, what this President has done is he’s taken executive actions — as I’ve talked about, we’ve talked about.  He’s created a task force.  He has done and taken action to do everything that he can from the executive branch to protect women, but we need more to be done.  We need more to be done.,And so, you know, we have to get Congress to act to make Roe v. Wade the law of the land.  And so, that is where we are right now.  But this is — this is — chaos was started by the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  And we’ve seen where extreme Republican elected officials have been on this issue.  We’ve seen that.,And so, that is something that we’re going to continue to make very clear to Americans, but I’m not going to speak to the upcoming election from here.,Q    Okay.  And also, on an interview that the President recently did, he said, “I think what he’s doing is a mistake.  I don’t agree with his approach,” talking about Netanyahu.  Can you clarify: What is the mistake?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we’ve talked about how the President spoke to President — Prime Minister Netanyahu just last week; they had a 30-minute conversation.  It was direct.  They have known each other for some time.  They have spoken over more than a dozen times since October 7th — the tragic, tragic attack that we’ve seen from Hamas, a terrorist organization.  And they said October 7th — they said October 7th would be something that they want to see over and over again.  So, they’ve had those conversations.,Look, the President has been very clear.  I started out this briefing talking about how humanitarian aid has increased, and that’s because of conversation — the conversation that the President had with the Prime Minister.  That’s important.,We need to make sure that civilians are protected.  We need to make sure that humanitarian aid workers are protected.  The President has said that.  That is what our focus is going to continue to be, as well as making sure that this hostage deal gets done — working around the clock to get that completed so we can get hostages home to their loved ones.,The President has always been very honest and direct with — with leaders, including the Prime Minister.,Q    So, does — just one more quick one.  Does the President believe Netanyahu’s approach, as you sort of just laid out there, is to blame for the famine that we are now seeing in Gaza?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  What I will say is I — that is not what the President is saying.  The President has been very clear that more needs to be done to pro- — to protect innocent civilians.  More work needs to be done to make sure that humanitarian aid workers — who are doing incredible work, who are being incredibly brave — are protected.  And so, that is what we’re speaking to.,And, unfortunately, we’ve seen more than 200 of humanitarian aid workers die, and that is something we do not want to continue to see.  That’s why the President had this conversation with the Prime Minister last week — a 30-minute direct conversation with the Prime Minister on what needs to be done to continue to protect innocent — innocent civilians.  That’s why we’re having conversation about that Rafah operations.  Right?,And our two sides are committed to — con- — moving forward with those conversations.  They’ve been pr- — they — we’ve seen some progress.  We’re going to continue to have those conversations.,And Israel has made commitments.  The Prime Minister kept — is — has made a commitment to the President.  We’ve seen an uptick of trucks — more than a thousand over the last three days.  That commitment is continuing.  We want to see more.  That’s good progress.,Go ahead, Justin.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  I also wanted to ask about the Univision interview.  The President said that he was “examining” ways to potentially shut down the border.  It’s a phrase that can mean lots of different things to —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — lots of different people, so I’m wondering if you could maybe explain what the President means when he talks about shutting —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I think the bottom line with all of this, and I’ve said this many times: The — the number-one way to really deal with what’s happening at the border is — is to move forward with the bipartisan agreement proposal that came forward out of the Senate and that obviously was rejected by Republicans because of what the former President told Republicans.,That’s what we want to see.  That’s how we deal with the broken system — the immigration system obviously being broken for decades now — and dealing with the challenges at the border.,We’re always going to look at executive actions.  We are, and we have been.  But really — really, truly to move forward, we have to make sure that we get this proposal done.,Q    I — I understand that your preference is obviously for that legislation to —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — Frankenstein back to life — (laughter) — but since the President himself said that you guys are looking at those executive actions, can you talk —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —,Q    Is it — is the, sort of, universe here just trying to restrict asylum claims?  Is it changing processing times?  Or is it as extr- — you know —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —,Q    — President Trump, when he talked about it, talked about le- — ending legal travel or legal trade across the border.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think what — here’s what I can say.  We evaluate all options.  Right?  We do.  We evaluate all options as it — as it regar- — as it relates to executive actions.  We just have not made a decision on this yet.,But we believe, the President believes it’s important to evaluate those options to see what’s at our disposable — our disposal to move forward.,And we haven’t made a decision.  But what we will continue to do is — because there is a proposal out there that is bipartisan, that is — would deal with what — the challenges that we’re seeing at the border, we think it’s important.  It was supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the — the Border Patrol unions.  It is a bipartisan, again, proposal that we think would be tough and fair.  We want to see Congress move forward with it.  And — and so, we’re going to continue to call for that.,But as — as it relates to what we’re looking at, we’re always looking at options.  I just don’t have anything.  We’re always going to evaluate our options.  I just don’t have anything to share.  We d- — haven’t made a decision.,Q    And really quickly.  The trilateral today is open to the press, but the —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — bilateral beforehand is not.  I was wondering, first, of course, to request that it be possible that we get in there.  But if not, if you could walk through why the White House decided — because normally those meetings are —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, no —,Q    — open.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — it’s a meeting between — obviously, between the two countries.  I think it’s important to note it shows the strength of the U.S. alliance and how important it is for these two countries to — to speak with one another and have this meeting.,Look, I will say this.  Their schedules, the — both schedules were — were, you know, the President and the Philippines leader have a very packed schedule.  And so, we weren’t able to make it into — open that to the press.,But what is important is there is going to be a trilat, which is a historic meeting that’s happening later today.  And you’ll have an opportunity — obviously, that is open to the press.  And you’ll have an opportunity there to see the three leaders together.,Go ahead.,Q    Two quick ones.  First, following up on Weijia.  In the White House’s view, who is to blame for the famine or imminent famine that we’re witnessing right now in Gaza?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Here’s our focus.  And — and I — I get the — the question.  And — and, you know — and the humanitarian situation in Gaza, obviously, is dire.  And that is why the President is doing everything that he can to get more humanitarian aid in.  And that’s what our focus is going to be.,Q    Was it a mistake —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Our focus —,Q    Was it a mistake not to push Benjamin Naten- — Netanyahu sooner to open Ashdod and Erez crossing, which would have allowed the prevention of what Samantha Power agrees is famine in Northern Gaza right now?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But here’s the thing.  For — every time the President has spoken to the Prime Minister, there’s — part of that conversation has been to do more on humanitarian aid.,Q    So, why did it change now?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It didn’t change.  It is a — it was a continued — it was the conversation that — that —,Q    Why did Netanyahu respond differently now?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s a c- — that’s a conversation with — for the Prime Minister.,Q    It wasn’t the potential that the U.S. would change policy —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It —,Q    — as the President said?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That is — that is a c- — that is a question for the Prime Minister.  But what I want to make sure that is very clear here is that we have seen a thousand trucks go — go into Gaza over the last three days.  That is important.,They have — the Prime Minister made commitments.  They are upholding their commitments.  We want to see more.  We’ve seen good progress.  And what we’re seeing in Gaza — obviously, we have said over, over again that the situation — the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire.,Q    Can you help me — last question.  Can you help me understand one thing?  Yesterday, the President made very clear that the U.S.’s commitment to Israel is, in his words — he said it twice —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — “ironclad.”,How can the U.S.’s commitment to Israel be, quote, “ironclad” when, in the statement released on behalf of the White House last week after his conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu, he said that the U.S. would reassess its policy as it relates to Israel given the way it prosecutes the war in Gaza?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the Pre- —,Q    How can it be ironclad and be reassessed?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, this is an important relationship that we have with Israel.  It is a — they are our friends.  And we have always said that we are committed to make sure that Israel’s security, especially against these threats that we’re hearing from Iran, that they are protected.,And we — and that is ironclad.  We’ve always been consistent there.  And we’re going to continue to be very clear about that.,The President made sure to put that at the top of his press conference because he wanted to continue that message, continue the message of making sure that America — we support Israel’s security, especially against these threats that we’re hearing from Iran and, also, their — their proxies.  And so, that hasn’t changed.  That hasn’t changed.,Q    Thank you, Karine.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Just another on Israel.  House Republicans are expected to bring up this resolution that’s critical of the President’s work with Netanyahu.  They say in the resolution they oppose efforts to place one-sided pressure on Israel with respect to Gaza, including calls for an immediate ceasefire.,Does the White House have any view on the resolution?  Is this constructive?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we believe the entire premise of — of the resolution is — is certainly flawed — is flawed, as — as it — as it claim of one-sided pressure against Israel, which this administration has supported militarily, diplomatically, and in — in myriad of other ways, both since October 7th and from our first day in office.,So, we oppose it.  And we call on members to vote against it.,Q    And just one more.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    The steelworkers union David McCall — leader — David McCall, was at the dinner last night.  You know, he obviously opposes this — this deal with Nippon Steel.  Was — was he invited because of this pending deal?  Was it —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.,Q    — an opportunity to allow him to speak to Japanese leadership?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I wouldn’t make that connection.  I wouldn’t make that connection.,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  I just want to clarify one of your earlier answers.  Did the administration send a direct warning to Iran not to attack Israel?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’ve been very clear.  I’ve — I’ve — we’ve been — I mean, you heard from the President — right? — and laid out our commitment to Israel and make sure Israel’s security — that continues.,And so, we’ve had those conversations.  I’m just not going to go into back-and-forth publicly.,Q    Well, the reason that I think it’s important to know is because you — you just shared earlier that, you know, the U.S. was quick to tell Iran directly that we had nothing to do with the strike ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

n Damascus.  The President hasn’t minced words on his feelings about Netanyahu.  But we haven’t gotten a very clear answer on whether it was communicated directly to Iran, “Don’t attack our ally.”,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just said we communicated to Iran.  I just said that.  I said we’re not going to go into b- — public back-and-forth on this.  But I said we communicated to Iran and we said had no involvement.  That’s what I said — right? — on the strike in Damascus and warned Iran.  We warned Iran.,So, I said that at the top and I’ll say —,Q    That was my only question.  Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.,Q    On the issue of inflation.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    There was a report in Politico on Tuesday that the former Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, was teeing off on the President’s, you know, talking about bridges all the time when he’s out on the campaign trail and not talking enough about the prices that people are paying.  We didn’t get any statement today on the PPI index.  You know, why — why aren’t we hearing more from the White House about the issues that people are facing at grocery stores and paying rent?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, the State of the Union, the President made very clear about what — he understands what the Americans are facing.  And he’s talked at almost every — every event that he’s had — crisscrossing the country after the State of the Union — about lowering costs, how important it is, and how there’s more work to do.  You hear that.,In New Hampshire and North Carolina, he spoke about his work to lower healthcare costs.  In La- — Las Vegas, he discussed his plan to build and renovate — renovate 2 million homes to lower housing costs.  In Madison, he announced his student debt re- — relief plan.,He also spoke with Senator Sanders just last week about his progress lowering costs for prescription drugs and inhalers.,This week, he spoke about plans to lower costs for childcare, home healthcare, eldercare.  He talks about lowering costs almost every event.  I just laid out the events that he did in March and in early April about how he’s making sure that — the number-one economic concerns that American have are lowering costs.,And just like Ron — Ron said this.  He said that the President has been — he believes — he believes in what the President has been doing in crisscrossing the country and talking about the state of the Union and talking about how we’re going to continue to cut costs for Americans and making sure that we do not give big tax giveaways to corporations.,That’s what Republicans are talking about.  They put out their — their budget, and their budget is to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.  That’s what they want to do.  And we’re doing the opposite.  We’re trying to protect that and lower costs for Americans.,Q    Is it at all inappropriate for the President to be commenting on what the Fed might or might not do with interest rate cuts?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the President, unlast — unlike the last one, has been very clear about giving the Fed the space to make independent decisions about how they’re going to move forward on their monetary decisions.  The President has always been very clear about that, and he’ll continue to do so.,And in his comment yesterday, he was also clear.  He said, “We don’t know what the Fed is going to do.”  And he was simply reflecting on public interpretation of recent datas, but he also said, “We do not know what the Fed is going to do.”,And we’ve always given them the space to make those decisions — those monetary decision independently and make sure that, again, they have the space to do that.,Go ahead.,Q    There’s been some discrepancies between what Israel is saying in terms of the number of trucks getting into Gaza that are full of aid versus some other aid groups, including the United Nations.  So, how is the White House exactly measuring what “good progress” is?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I — I’m not going to get into the nitty-gitty — -gritty here.  I will leave it up to — up to — up to — up to them to speak to what they’re seeing.  But we believe — I mean, we’re talking about a thousand trucks in over three days.  That matters — a thousand trucks.,Q    But a lot of the U.N. folks are saying that some of those trucks are not completely full.  There are trucks that are half full that are being counted.  So, what are the measurements here in terms of what is effective aid delivery?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think when we are hearing more than a thousand trucks and we’re seeing that — we’re — I just said 300 trucks just yesterday — that matters.  There’s more — there’s more access being allowed.  The trucks are being allowed to come in.  That matters.,And so, look, that’s what — that’s what we are — we’re continuing to see.  We believe that Israel is keeping their promise.,There’s more work to be done.  Right?  We need to see the ports open.  We need to — we need to see that as well.,But we’re seeing progress here.,Q    And in —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re seeing progress.,Q    And in terms of the distribution once the trucks are in — I mean, northern Gaza, obviously, experiencing a lot more famine that’s setting in, as was talked about earlier.  What is the White House tracking?  Or how is the White House, if at all, trying to facilitate some of the distribution?  And are — are there concerns about how it’s getting to the regions where it most needs to be?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we’re going to continue to have conversations with the Israeli government on how they’re — how these — how this aid is being distributed.  We want to make sure — it is important.  Here’s what is important: It is important that the innocent people in — in Gaza, the Palestinians, get that im- — all-important aid.  We know what’s going on there.  Obviously, it’s dire.,And so, we’re going to continue to have those diplomatic conversations, be very straightforward with our — with our Israel counterparts here.,But they made a promise.  We’re seeing a difference here.  We’re seeing aid getting in.  Of course, it’s not going to be enough.  Right?  Of course, we need to see more progress.  Of course, we know what the — how dire the situation is in Israel — and I’m sorry, in — in Gaza.,And so, we’re going to continue to have those conversation with Israel government.,Yeah.,Q    Yeah, thanks, Karine.  You said President Biden still hasn’t made a decision on taking executive action on the border.  Why is there a holdup on making a final decision on this?  What factors are being considered before the White House makes a call on this matter?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I mean, look, Joe, we — we spent a couple of months working with the Senate Republicans and Democrats to make sure that we came up with a bipartisan solution to deal with the border — right? — to deal with the challenges at the border.  We believe that that was the best way — we still believe that’s the best way to move forward because it would be tough, it would be fair, and — and it’s gotten support from places that you would never think — right? — the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Border Patrol union.  That’s important.,And so, we believe that is the best way to move forward here.  We’re always going to evaluate other options as it relates to executive action.  But we are continuing to be clear here: The best way to move forward is to get that bipartisan proposal forward and for, you know, Republicans to not pick politics here, to pick a majority of the American people.,Q    I mean, is a matter of there being concerns about opening the administration up to litigation on this with executive a- — action, or —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, that’s why we came up with the bipartisan proposal — right? — because we believe that the way to actually deal with this is legislation.  The — the way to actually deal with this is to turn legislation into law, obviously.,And so, that is the best way to move forward.  And no executive action is going to have the full — the full resources that we need to — to get this done — to get this done.,We’re going to evaluate all of our options, as we’ve been saying, but we have to continue to be really clear here.  Republicans need to act.  They need to move forward.,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you.  Following up on my colleagues Weijia and Peter.  You said earlier that the President is doing everything he can on getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.  I have to respectfully suggest that that’s not true, because it took until seven aid workers were killed last week for the President to even suggest that he would change U.S. policy and possibly condition humanitarian — condition defense aid on the humanitarian situation in Israel.,So, how can you stand there —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — and say the President is doing everything he can when, for weeks and weeks and weeks now, even as NGOs and aid groups warned that famine was imminent, he continued to refuse to pull on that lever and link defense aid to humanitarian aid.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, first of all, the President has done airdr- — we’ve done airdrops.  We’re going to do this pier.  We’ve talked about, for the past several months, how we need to do more and how we’re going to uptick our efforts to get that humanitarian aid into Gaza.,We understand what’s going on.  We understand that the dire — it — what it — the dire needs there are.  And so, the President has — we’ve announced we’re going to do this pier.  Right?  We’ve done — done this airdrops.,And so, we have had the conversation with the Prime Minister multiple times, with the Israeli government almost every day on what needs to be done.  And we’ve had those conversations with them.,And so, now we are seeing an uptick.  That is important.  That is indeed what we want to see.  We’ve also been working on doing this hostage deal.  The President has been working around the clock.,So, I take — I take offense to what you’re saying because it isn’t true.  The President has been working on this hostage deal for months now — for months now.,Q    Respectfully, the hostage deal that —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, wait — for months now.  And that is a way to make sure that there is a temporary ceasefire that could pr- — hopefully lead to something longer, get those hostages home, and get humanitarian aid.,And so, that is what we have been also focusing on really diligently —,Q    But — but —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — for the last t- —,Q    But with all due respect, Karine —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    With all due respect —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — my question was on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the famine, which has been something that aid groups —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But that’s the same —,Q    — have warned about for weeks.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The hostage deal includes humanitarian aid getting into Gaza.,Q    But —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  That’s what he’s been working on — this humanitarian aid to get into Gaza — and, also, get those hostages home.,Q    But why — why is it — because it sounds like —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But you’re saying that we haven’t done anything.,Q    No.  No.  I —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, but — no, but it’s what you’re saying.,Q    You said the President has done — has been doing all he can.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s been working 24/7, around the clock —,Q    I have — I have —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — to do what he can —,Q    — no doubt.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But —,Q    But he has not — he has not until recently even suggested that he would condition military aid, which Israel needs, on them allowing food and humanitarian aid into Gaza, which the people of Gaza need.  That has been — I hate to use the term —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    — a red line every time I or any of my colleagues have asked —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m — I’m not —,Q    — in this briefing room about this.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And you’ve heard from the National Security Advisor.  I’m not going to get into red lines from here.,Here’s what I can say: The hostage deal includes getting the humanitarian aid in.  We’ve been working on that.  We’ve been working on getting that hostage deal done.  We’re going to continue to do that.,You’ve heard us say that we’ve worked around the clock to get those hostages home — which, by the way, includes American hostages as well — and getting that aid in.  We know how dire the situation is — is in Gaza.  We are very aware of that.,And we’ve had conversations almost every day with our counterparts in the Israeli government.  We’ve had conversations, more than a dozen, with the Prime Minister.,And so, it is important — it is important to get that aid in.  We understand that.  We understand that, and we’re going to have those conversations every day to make sure that it continues.,Q    Thank you.  And one un- — one more, unrelated.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    Earlier this week, the former President met with Lord Cameron, the British Foreign Secretary.  He has, in recent weeks, met with Viktor Orbán, the leader of Hungary.  He has said he’s spoken to Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia.  There is a long history of Republican presidential candidates meddling in foreign policy to undermine their Democratic opponents.,Without getting into Hatch Act territory — you know, telling people to vote for or against someone — is the administration concerned that this private citizen could be working against U.S. interests in the interests of his own political ones?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And you’re talking about his meeting specifically with —,Q    With — with foreign leaders: Lord Cameron, his talking with MBS, Viktor Orbán, and others possibly.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, a- — look, as it relates to other — other leaders and those types of meetings — specifically, let’s — let’s talk about David Cameron.  The UK noted earlier this week it is common for officials from other countries to meet with representatives of different parties.  That includes the United States, as we routinely meet with political leaders of different parties as well.,For instance, we hosted Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid yesterday — at the beginning of the week — at the beginning of the week.  And so, it’s not uncommon.,I am going to be really careful here, because you’re talking about a presidential candidate.  I’m going to be really mindful.  I used David Cameron as an example.  But I’m going to be really mindful.  I’m not speaking beyond that.,Go ahead.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Governor Moore is apparently on the Hill today.  He was there earlier this week meeting with lawmakers.  Is — has he been down to the White House to meet with officials to talk about funding for the bridge?  And can you give us an update on the President’s conversations with lawmakers to get that funding moving forward?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, we — yeah, look, we have said to Congress that we want to continue to work with them to make sure that the Key Bridge is back up and that the — Baltimore gets what it needs, certainly, to — to be whole again.  And obviously, we’re getting that port open.,We’ve been in regular touch with Governor Moore.  You know the President was with him very recently.  And they have had continuous conversations about what Baltimore needs.,The President said, when he was in Baltimore: We will be with Baltimore and the — and the state of Maryland for as long as they need to get this done.,I don’t have a specific readout to share with you.  But we’ve been in regular communication.  Our Office of Leg Affairs has been in regular communication with members of Congress.  Our — our Intergovernmental Affairs folks, Tom Perez, has been leading on this issue as it relates to Baltimore and the needs there.,And also, let’s not forget our — our Department of Labor has been very involved, as well, in making sure — you know, dealing with the economic situation and how we can help on that front as well.,So, don’t have anything to read out as far as the conversations, but —,Q    And —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — we’ve been there for them.,Q    And is there any better sense now that we’re, you know, a coup- — another week passed this — and the President’s conversation last week and the briefing he got there — on an estimate of how much this is going to cost?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have an estimate for you.  We’re going to talk to our — our — the Maryland delegation, have those conversation.  Don’t have an estimate for you to share — to share.,DO- — Department of Transportation announced $60 million really right — right aft- — the week after the — the bridge collapsed.  And so, we know that’s — that’s there to help.,Don’t have a — a final estimation.  Obviously, we’re going to continue to talk to the delegation.,Go ahead, Jon.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Back in late December, President Biden, in response to a question that I asked him, said that he could not think of one reason for presidents to receive total immunity from prosecution.  Four months later, does the President continue to have that same belief?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Don’t have anything beyond what the President shared with you.,Q    And in two weeks’ time, a Supreme Court case will happen.  It’s Donald J. Trump vs. the United States.,Earlier this week, there was an amicus brief that was filed by more than a dozen retired generals and admirals opposing this legal theory that Donald Trump and his lawyers have that he does have total immunity from criminal prosecution.  Does the White House, the administration plan to file an amicus brief of their own on this particular issue?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the Department of Justice.,Q    Is there any effort to have the former presidents — that you know of — to file an amicus brief taking one side or another on this particular issue?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Say that one more time.,Q    Is there any effort that you are aware of of the former presidents, the predecessors of President Biden — President George W. Bush, President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, Jimmy Carter — to file a joint amicus brief, either taking a position one way or another on this particular matter?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No.,Go ahead.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  I’m going to ask you about inflation.  So, yesterday in the Rose Garden, the President said that when — when he came into office, inflation was skyrocketing.  But it was 1.4 percent in January of 2021, and that was the 11th consecutive month, at that time, under 2 percent.  So, was the President misleading Americans?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, when — when the President took office — and you know this — there was a pandemic.  It was closing down businesses, closing down schools.  And so, it was drastically disrupting the supply chain.  Let’s not forget about that.  And — and so, that’s what was going on.  And that caused inflation around the world to increase.  We know that.,And — and then further increasing inflation was the — the Russia’s war — Russia’s war in Ukraine.  And in fact, many other countries are even worse off because of — of that — of — because of what we seen with Russia’s war.,So, the President took historic action to deal with the disruption of the supply chain.  Let’s not forget what he did with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.,And so, we have made progress in lowering costs.  We’ve made progress in dealing with inflation.,But that’s what was happening when we walked in: the pandemic, the disruption of the supply chain.  All of these things were happening when the President walk — took office.,Q    But the President didn’t say “the supply chain was being disrupted.”  He said “inflation was skyrocketing.”,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But that’s what he was referring to.  Right?  That’s what was going on.  Those were the things that were happening right before us.  The pandemic — it was taking thousands of lives a day when he — when he took office; schools were closed — were — a majority of schools were closed; businesses were closing; and we had a supply chain that was disrupted.  And so, that’s what the President was speaking to and laying out.,And then inflation — down the road — became even more — increased even more because of the war that Russia had t- — had — had taken on into Ukraine.,Q    But the Fed’s — the Fed’s supply chain measure actually went down in November at that time.  So — so, is the President being honest about inflation?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President has said what — he — he said what he saw when he was — when he took — when he took office.  The pandemic was happening, right?  It disrupted the supply chain.  We know — you know what happens when the supply chain is disrupted.  You know what that leads to.  And so, that’s what he was speaking to.,And not only that, we — he had to — we also saw a war in Ukraine that — that Mr. Putin, an aggressive — aggression that Mr. Putin was — was putting into Ukraine — set forth.  And so, the President had to take historic action, take aggressive action in dealing with the disruption in the supply chain.  He had to — he released the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so that we can deal with the supply chain.,And he continued to take action to lower costs.  And that’s what we’ve seen — whether it’s healthcare costs, whether it’s dealing with junk fees, whether it’s prescription drugs — lowering those costs.  That’s what the President took action in.,But we saw what was happening when the President took office.  We did.,Q    Thanks, Karine.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.  Okay.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  As you know, there — there’s a tradition, dating back to the Truman administration, of offering intelligence briefings to major party presidential nominees.  President Trump was declared the presumptive nominee on March 6th.  Has the White House offered intel briefings to former President Trump?  And if so, how — have they begun?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I would refer you to the ODNI.  That’s for them to speak to.,Thanks, everybody.,Q    Thank you, Karine.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  See you tomorrow.,2:51 P.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington," DC 20500""",11-04-24,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/04/11/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-56/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Global Partners for the Future,Over the course of the last three years, the U.S.-Japan Alliance has reached unprecedented heights. We arrived at this historic moment because our nations, individually and together, took courageous steps to strengthen our collective capacity in ways that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. Today, we, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Prime Minister KISHIDA Fumio, celebrate this new era of U.S.-Japan strategic cooperation during the Prime Minister’s Official Visit and State Dinner in Washington, D.C.—and pledge that the United States and Japan will continue our tireless work, together and with other partners, to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and world.,In this new era of U.S.-Japan cooperation, we recognize that global events affect the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific, and that developments in our shared region reverberate around the world. We are therefore working together, across all domains and at all levels, to build a global partnership that is fit for purpose to address the complex, interconnected challenges of today and tomorrow for the benefit of our two countries and the world. As our Alliance cooperation reaches new heights, we are expanding our engagement to reflect the global nature of our partnership.,At the core of our cooperation is a shared commitment to work with like-minded partners and multilateral institutions to address common challenges and to ensure a world that is free, open, connected, resilient, and secure. These joint efforts are based on our shared fundamental respect for international law, including the protection and promotion of human rights and dignity, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, and the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force. Our purpose as partners is to uphold and bolster the free and open international order based on the rule of law that has allowed so many nations to develop and prosper, and to ensure our Alliance is equipped to tackle the challenges of the 21,st,century.,To advance our global partnership, today we announce several new strategic initiatives to strengthen our defense and security cooperation; reach new frontiers in space; drive technology innovation; bolster economic security; accelerate climate action; partner on global diplomacy and development; and fortify the ties between our peoples. Through our global partnership, we are also synchronizing our strategies, and our two nations have never been more united as we work together to address the most pressing challenges and opportunities of the future.,Strengthening our Defense and Security Cooperation,The core of our global partnership is our bilateral defense and security cooperation under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, which is stronger than ever. We affirm that our Alliance remains the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden reiterated the unwavering commitment of the United States to the defense of Japan under Article V of the Treaty, using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. Prime Minister Kishida reaffirmed Japan’s unwavering commitment to fundamentally reinforce its own defense capabilities and roles, and to enhance its close coordination with the United States under the Treaty.President Biden also reaffirmed that Article V applies to the Senkaku Islands. We reiterated our strong opposition to any attempts by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea, including through actions that seek to undermine Japan’s longstanding and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands. We welcome the progress in optimizing Alliance force posture in areas including the Southwestern Islands to strengthen U.S.-Japan deterrence and response capabilities, and we confirm the importance of further advancing this initiative.,The United States welcomes the steps Japan is taking to fundamentally enhance its defense capabilities, including its plans to increase the budget for its defense capabilities and complementary initiatives to two percent of GDP in Japanese Fiscal Year (JFY) 2027 in accordance with Japan’s National Security Strategy, its decision to possess counterstrike capabilities, and its plans to stand up the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) Joint Operations Command to enhance command and control of the JSDF. Together, these initiatives elevate our defense ties to unprecedented levels and launch a new era of U.S.-Japan security cooperation, strengthening our Alliance and contributing to stability in the Indo-Pacific.,Today, we announce several new strategic initiatives to further advance our Alliance. Recognizing the speed at which regional security challenges evolve and to ensure our bilateral Alliance structures meet these critical changes, we announce our intention to bilaterally upgrade our respective command and control frameworks to enable seamless integration of operations and capabilities and allow for greater interoperability and planning between U.S. and Japanese forces in peacetime and during contingencies. More effective U.S.-Japan Alliance command and control will strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges. We call on our respective defense and foreign ministries to develop this new relationship through the Security Consultative Committee (our security “2+2”). In support of this vision, we also reaffirm our goal to deepen Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance cooperation and Alliance information sharing capabilities, including through the Bilateral Information Analysis Cell.,We will also continue to implement efforts to strengthen our Alliance force posture, build high-end base capabilities, and increase preparedness that are necessary to deter and defend against threats. We resolve to deepen bilateral cooperation toward the effective development and employment of Japan’s suite of counterstrike capabilities, including the provision of U.S. materiel and technological support to enhance Japan’s indigenous stand-off programs. The United States expressed its commitment to start the training pipeline and ship modifications for Japan to acquire operational capability of the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) system. We also reaffirmed our pursuit of a Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) cooperative development program to counter high-end, regional hypersonic threats.,As our countries strengthen our bilateral ties, we will continue to build our relationships with like-minded partners in the region. Today, we announce our vision to cooperate on a networked air defense architecture among the United States, Japan, and Australia to counter growing air and missile threats. Recognizing Japan’s strengths and the close bilateral defense partnerships with the AUKUS countries, AUKUS partners – Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – are considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects. Continuing the momentum from the Camp David Summit, we welcome progress on establishing an annual multidomain exercise between the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ROK). Recognizing the commitments made in the Atlantic Declaration and the Hiroshima Accord, and as the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions become ever more interlinked, we welcome the announcement of regular U.S.-Japan-UK trilateral exercises, beginning in 2025, as we enhance our shared and enduring security. Building on the announcement at the Australia Official Visit in October to pursue trilateral cooperation with Japan on unmanned aerial systems, we are exploring cooperative opportunities in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.,The United States welcomes Japan’s revision of the Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and its Implementation Guidelines, which bolsters cooperation through joint development and production to enhance our deterrence capabilities in the region.

We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion, including destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, such as unsafe encounters at sea and in the air as well as the militarization of disputed features and the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia. The PRC’s recent dangerous and escalatory behavior supporting its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea as well as efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation are inconsistent with international law as reflected in UNCLOS. We also emphasize that the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award is final and legally binding on the parties to that proceeding. We resolve to work with partners, particularly in ASEAN, to support regional maritime security and uphold international law.,We emphasize that our basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged and reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity.

Building on the historic success of the Camp David Trilateral Summit, the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea continue to collaborate on promoting regional security, strengthening deterrence, coordinating development and humanitarian assistance, countering North Korea’s illicit cyber activities, and deepening our cooperation including on economic, clean energy, and technological issues. The United States and Japan also remain committed to advancing trilateral cooperation with Australia to ensure a peaceful and stable region.,We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea in accordance with relevant UNSC resolutions. We strongly condemn North Korea’s continued development of its ballistic missile program—including through launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and space launch vehicles using ballistic missile technologies—which poses a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. We call on North Korea to respond to continued, genuine offers to return to diplomacy without preconditions. We call on all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UNSC resolutions, especially in light of Russia’s recent veto. We urge North Korea to cease illicit activities that generate revenue for its unlawful ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs, including malicious cyber activities.

We are committed to continuing to impose severe sanctions on Russia and provide unwavering support for Ukraine. Together, we reiterate our call on Russia to immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw its forces from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Any threat or use of nuclear weapons in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia is unacceptable. We also express serious concerns about growing North Korea-Russia military cooperation, which is supporting Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and threatens to undermine peace and stability in Northeast Asia as well as the global non-proliferation regime.,As the linkages between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific regions have become stronger than ever, our two countries look forward to continuing to work together to enhance Japan-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and NATO-Indo-Pacific Four partnerships.,We once again unequivocally condemn the terror attacks by Hamas and others on October 7 of last year, and reaffirm Israel’s right to defend itself and its people consistent with international law. At the same time, we express our deep concern over the critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. We affirm the imperative of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize that the deal to release hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza. We affirm the imperative of realizing an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza over a period of at least six weeks as part of a deal that would release hostages held by Hamas and allow for delivery of essential additional humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in need. We underscore the urgent need to significantly increase deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza and the crucial need to prevent regional escalation. We reiterate the importance of complying with international law, including international humanitarian law, as applicable, including with regard to the protection of civilians. We remain committed to an independent Palestinian state with Israel’s security guaranteed as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace.,We reaffirm the importance of supporting inclusive growth and sustainable development in Latin America and the Caribbean. We continue to enhance policy coordination in the region, in particular on Haiti and Venezuela. We also recognize that promoting the stability and security for Haiti is one of the most pressing challenges in the Western Hemisphere, and we continue to support Haiti in restoring democratic order.,We also support African aspirations for peace, stability, and prosperity based on the rule of law. We continue to work together to support the democratic process and economic growth through our respective efforts, including our cooperation with African countries, Regional Economic Communities, the African Union, and multilateral organizations.,The United States and Japan are resolved to achieve a world without nuclear weapons through realistic and pragmatic approaches. It is critical that the overall decline in global nuclear arsenals achieved since the end of the Cold War continues and not be reversed, and the PRC’s accelerating build-up of its nuclear arsenal without transparency nor meaningful dialogue poses a concern to global and regional stability. We reaffirm the importance of upholding the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the cornerstone of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and for the pursuit of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In promoting this universal goal of achieving a world without nuclear weapons, Japan’s “Hiroshima Action Plan” and the “G7 Leaders’ Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament” are welcome contributions. The two leaders also welcomed the U.S. announcement to join the Japan-led “Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty Friends” initiative. We reaffirm the indispensable role of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, committing to fostering innovation and supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency’s efforts in upholding the highest standards of safety, security, and safeguards.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,South Lawn,10:14 A.M. EDT,PRESIDENT BIDEN: Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Kishida, welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. On behalf of Jill and me, the Vice President and the Second Gentleman, and all the American people, welcome to the White House.,Sixty-four years ago, our two nations signed a Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. President Eisenhower said his goal was to establish an indestructible partnership between our countries. Today, the world can see that goal has been achieved and that partnership between us is unbreakable.,The alliance between Japan and the United States is a cornerstone of peace, security, prosperity in the — in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. Ours is truly a global partnership. For that, Mr. Prime Minister Kishida, I thank you.,The Prime Minister is a visionary and courageous leader. When Russia began its brutal invasion of Ukraine two years ago, he did not hesitate to condemn, sanction, and isolate Russia and provide billions in assistance to Ukraine.,Under his leadership, Japan set in motion profound changes in its defense policies and its capabilities. Now — now our two countries are building a stronger defense partnership and a stronger Indo-Pa- — stronger Indo-Pacific than ever before.,As President of the G7 last year, the Prime Minister rallied Japan’s partners to take action on nuclear disarmament, global poverty, economic resilience, and other critical issues that shape peace, security, and opportunity for billions of people around the world.,And last year, the Prime Minister took one of the boldest steps yet when he and President Yoon of the Republic of Korea decided to heal old wounds and start a new chapter of friendship. Our historic summit that I hosted at Camp David marked the start of an entirely new era infused with hope, shared values, and focused relentlessly forward because these leaders know that the division that defined us in the past do not need to define us in the future.,That has also been the story of Japan and the United States. Just a few generations ago, our two nations were locked in a devastating conflict. It would have been easy to say we remain adversaries. Instead, we made a far better choice: We became the closest of friends.,Today, our economic relationship is one of the strongest and deepest in the world. Our democracies are beacons of freedom, shining across the globe. And the ties of friendship, family connect the Japanese and American people as a source of joy, meaning — and meaning for millions — millions of our people.,Japanese Americans have made historic contributions across American life for generations. That includes my mentor and one of my closest friends ever in the United States Senate, Senator Daniel Inouye — a decorated war hero, a U.S. senator for nearly 50 years, and a recipient of the Medal of Honor.,Yesterday, Prime Minister laid a wreath at the National Japanese American Memorial in honor of Danny Inouye’s 100th birthday, something I truly appreciate you having done. (Applause.),Mr. Prime Minister, you and I have been entrusted with protecting and advancing the monumental alliance between our two great democracies. Together, we made it closer, stronger, and more effective than ever before in history.,I thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your partnership, your leadership, and your personal friendship.,Let me end with this. It’s spring in Washington. The sun is shining. And every spring, cherry blossoms bloom across the city thanks to a gift from Japan of 3,000 cherry trees over a century ago. People travel all over our country and the world to see these magni- — these magnificent blossoms.,Last night, the Prime Minister and Mrs. Kishida, Jill and I, took a stroll down the driveway across the lawn here at the White House to visit three cherry blossom trees. One that Jill and Mrs. Kishida planted together a year ago. The other two are among the 250 new trees that Japan has given the United States to honor our 250th birthday two years from now. They’ll be planted at the Tidal Basin, not far from the Martin Luther King Memorial. And like our friendship, these trees are timeless, inspiring, and thriving.,May God bless the Japanese and American people. And may God protect our troops.,Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Kishida, welcome back to the White House. (Applause.) The floor is yours.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you.,PRESIDENT BIDEN: The trouble is, we’ve become good friends. (Laughs.),Please.,AIDE: Distinguished guests, the Prime Minister of Japan. (Applause.),PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Mr. President, Dr. Biden, distinguished guests. I thank President Biden for the warm words of welcome. I am very pleased to see that the cherry tree that my wife, Yuko, planted with Dr. Biden last year is growing beautifully.,The cherry trees along the Potomac River are a symbol of the friendship between Japan and the United States. These Japanese-born cherry trees have been sounding the arrival of spring to the city every year for over 110 years. Just as the local residents have cherished and protected these cherry trees, the Japan-U.S. relationship has been supported and nurtured by the many people who love each other’s country.,The development of the Japan-U.S. relationship is the fruit of the historical cooperation between the two countries. Along with the trust between the leaders and cooperation between our governments, numerous people-to-people exchanges in ranging fields have shaped the friendship between our countries.,The cooperation between our countries, bound together by common values and commitments, has become a global one with the scope and depth covering outer space and the deep sea.,Today, the world faces more challenges and difficulties than ever before. As a global partner, Japan will join hands with our American friends and, together, we will lead the way in tackling the challenges of the Indo-Pacific region and the world while tirelessly developing the relationship between our countries with a view to the world 10 and even 100 years from now.,In Japan, it is said that the Somei Yoshino, which are the cherry trees planted in this area, have a lifespan of about 60 years. However, thanks to the efforts of the cherry tree guardians, the trees have shown their strong vitality, blooming beautifully for more than 100 years without waning.,When I heard that some of the trees would be replaced, as President Biden mentioned earlier, I decided to send 250 new cherry trees to commemorate the upcoming 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States. (Applause.),The friendship between Japan and the United States will continue to grow and bloom around the world, thriving on friendship, respect, and trust of the people of both countries. I am confident that the cherry-blossom-like bond of the Japan-U.S. alliance will continue to grow even thicker and stronger here, in the Indo-Pacific, and in all corners of the world.,Mr. President, Dr. Biden, distinguished guests, thank you, once again, for your warm welcome, hospitality, and friendship.,(In English.)

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Rose Garden,1:23 P.M. EDT,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Please, have a seat.,It’s an honor to stand here today with the Prime Minister of Japan, President Kishi- — Prime Minister Kishida.,When I became president, I said that the United States would rebuild the muscle of our demo- — democratic alliances and we’d stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies again, because our alliances are America’s greatest asset.  The relationship with Japan is powerful proof of that — that in investing in our alliance and raising our collective ambitions, we yield remarkable results.,Over the last three years, the partnership between Japan and the United States has been transformed into a truly global partnership.  And that’s thanks in no small part to the courageous leadership of Prime Minister Kishida.  And I mean that sincerely.,Together, our countries are taking significant steps to strengthen defense and security cooperation, we’re modernizing command and control structures, and we’re increasing the interoperability and planning of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way.,This is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since the end — since it was first established.,I’m also pleased to announce that for the first time, Japan and the United States and Australia will create a networked system of air, missile, and defense architecture.  We’re also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom.,And our AUKUS defense partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom is exploring how Japan can join our work in the second pillar, which focuses on advanced capabilities, including AI, autonomous systems.  All told, that represents a new benchmark for our military cooperation across a range of capabilities.,On the economic front, our ties have never been more robust.  Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States.  Say that again: Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States.  And we, the United States, are the top foreign investor in Japan. Nearly 1 million Americans work in Japanese companies here in the United States.,And to name just one example, a few months ago, Toyota announced an $8 billion investment in a massive battery production facility in North Carolina, which will inc- — employ thousands of people.  The Prime Minister is going to travel to North Carolina tomorrow to visit that project.,Don’t stay.  Don’t stay.  We need you back in Japan.  (Laughter.)  They’ll probably try to keep you.,We also affirmed the science and education ties between Japan and the United States.  Those tries — ties stretch up to the moon, where two Japanese astronauts will join future American missions, and one will become the first non-American ever to land on the moon.,And they reach into the high schools and universities, as well, where the Mineta Ambassadors — Minetas Program exists, named for our dear friend Norm Mineta.  We’re going to invest in new student exchanges, help train the next generation of Japanese and American leaders.,We also discussed developments in the Middle East, including our shared support for a ceasefire and a hostage deal and urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian crisis that exists in Gaza.,We also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign- — they — they’re threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel.  As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel’s security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad.  Let me say it again: ironclad.  We’re going to do all we can to protect Israel’s security.,And, finally, I want to commend the Prime Minister himself.  He is a statesman.  Command — you know, the fact is that you condemned Putin’s invasion of — brutal invasion of Ukraine when it happened.  You pledged more than $12 billion in aid; prioritizing nuclear nonproliferation at the United Nations Security Council; standing strong with the United States as we stand up for freedom of navigation, including in the South China Sea and as we maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits; and taking the brave step of mending ties with the Republic of Korea so we can all stand shoulder to shoulder together.,Tomorrow, we will both be joined by another good friend, President Marcos of the Philippines, for a trilateral summit — the first of its kind.,And through it all, our commitment to the defense of Japan under Article 5, including the Sena- — excuse me — Senkaku Islands, is unwavering.,Mr. Prime Minister, through our partnership, we have strengthened this alliance.  We have expanded our work together.  We have raised our shared ambitions.  And now, the U.S.-Japan alliance is a beacon to the entire world.,There’s no limit to what our countries can and our people can do together.,So, thank you for your partnership, your leadership, and your friendship.,And now, over to you, Mr. Prime Minister.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  Thank you, Joe.,(As interpreted.)  President Biden and I have met and talked countless times and confirmed our shared notion that we are at crucial crossroads and that Japan-U.S. partnership is immensely important.,The international community stands at a historical turning point.  In order for Japan, the U.S., the Indo-Pacific region, and, for that matter, the whole world to enjoy peace, stability, and prosperity lasting into the future, we must resolutely defend and further solidify a free and open international order based on the rule of law.,And again, today, I told the President that now is the time to demonstrate the true values that Japan and the United States can offer as global partners, that we must together fulfill our responsibilities to create a world where human dignity is upheld and that Japan will always stand firm with the United States.,I explained that, based on our national security strategy, Japan is determined to strengthen our defense force through position of counterstrike capabilities, increase our defense budget and other initiatives, and was reassured by President Biden of his strong support for such efforts.,In such context, we confirmed again the urgency to further bolster the deterrence and response capabilities of our alliance and concurred on reinforcing our security and defense cooperation to increase interoperability between the U.S. forces and our self-defense forces, including the improvement of our respective command-and-control frameworks.,We will be discussing the specifics as we plan for the next Japan-U.S. two-plus-two.,The President and I went on to discuss various specific challenges faced by the international community.,First, we confirmed that unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion is absolutely unacceptable, wherever it may be, and that we will continue to respond resolutely against such action through cooperation with allies and likeminded nations.,From such perspective, we agreed that our two countries will continue to respond to challenges concerning China through close coordination.  At the same time, we confirmed the importance of continuing our dialogue with China and cooperating with China on common challenges.,We also underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and confirmed our position to encourage peaceful resolution of the Cross-Straits issue.,The situation in North Korea, including nuclear and missiles development, was brought up as well.  We welcomed the progress seen in many areas of cooperation based on the outcome of the Japan-U.S.-ROK summit last August and concurred to coordinate even more closely as we face serious concerns under the current state of affairs.,President Biden once again demonstrated his strong support towards the immediate resolution of the abduction issue.,We reaffirmed the importance of realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific based on the rule of law and concurred to maintain close collaboration through various opportunities, including the Japan-U.S.-Philippines summit, which is planned for tomorrow.,Regarding Russia’s aggression of Ukraine, based on,a recognition that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow — taking the issue as our own problem for Japan, I expressed our resolution to continue with stringent sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine.  And we concurred to maintain close partnership with likeminded countries.,On the situation in the Middle East, I expressed my respect for the efforts of President Biden towards the release of the hostages, improvement of the humanitarian situation, and for calming down the situation.  I then explained how Japan is continuing diplomatic efforts to improve the humanitarian situation and to realize a sustainable ceasefire,and agreed to continue close cooperation towards the improvement of the situation, the realization of a two-state solution, and the stabilization of the region.,Regarding the economy, we firstly concurred that for both of us to lead the global economic growth together, the promotion of investment in both directions is important.  I explained how Japanese businesses are making a significant contribution to the U.S. economy by the investment and the creation of jobs, to which President Biden agreed.,In order to maintain and strengthen the competitive edge in the area of advanced technologies and to respond appropriately to issues such as economic coercion, non-market policies and practices, and excess capacities and to overcome the vulnerability of the supply chains and to lead a sustainable and inclusive economic growth, we affirmed that the collaboration of Japan and the United States is indispensable.,In addition, we concurred to advance our cooperation in the areas such as decarbonization, AI, and start-ups.,There was a huge achievement also in the area of space.  In the first half of the 1960s, when I was in the United States, it was the dawn of space development in the United States.  I am one of all those who were so excited in the U.S. by the spectacular challenge in space.,The implementing arrangement has been signed on this occasion and the provision of the lunar rover by Japan and the allocation of two astronaut flight opportunities to the lunar surface to Japan were confirmed.  Under the Artemis program, I welcome the lunar landing by a Japanese astronaut as the first non-U.S. astronaut.,We also discussed the efforts towards a world without nuclear weapons.  We affirmed the realistic and practical endeavors of nuclear disarmament, including the issuance of the G7 Leaders’ Hiroshima Vision last year.  And I welcomed the participation of the United States in the FMCT Friends, which was launched by my initiative.,Lastly, in order to further strengthen the people-to-people bond, which is the cornerstone of our unwavering Japan-U.S. relationship, we affirmed to further promote people-to-people exchanges.,As the outcome of our meeting today, we will issue the joint statement titled “The Global Partners for the Future.”  This is the expression of the determination of Japan and the United States to maintain and strengthen a free and open international order based on the rule of law that underpins the peace, stability, and prosperity of the international community and states the guiding principles.,With our partnership, we will defend the future of Japan and the United States, the Indo-Pacific, and the world and make that future all the more prosperous.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  Now we’ll take a few questions.,Jordan Fabian of Bloomberg.,Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Last month, you predicted the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates thanks to falling inflation.  But today, data showed that inflation rose more than expected for the third straight month.  So, how concerned are you about the fight against inflation stalling?  And do you stand by your prediction for a rate cut?,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out there will a rate cut.  This may delay it a month or so.  I’m not sure of that.  I don’t — we don’t know what the Fed is going to do for certain.,But, look, we have dramatically reduced inflation from 9 percent down to close to 3 percent.  We’re in a situation where we’re better situated than we were when we took office where we — inflation was skyrocketing.  And we have a plan to deal with it, whereas the opposition — my opposition talks about two things.  They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people.,And so, I think they’re — they have no plan.  Our plan is one I think is still sustainable.,Q    Mr. Prime Minister, you said that the Nippon Steel acquisition of U.S. Steel is a private matter.  But I’m wondering: Did you discuss the matter today with President Biden?  And do you believe that politics are influencing President Biden’s decision to oppose the deal?,And I wouldn’t mind, Mr. President, if you answer that one too.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  On the issue that you have raised, we understand that discussions are underway between the parties.  We hope these discussions will unfold in directions that would be positive for both sides.,Japan believes that appropriate procedures based on law is being implemented by the U.S. government.  Japan is the largest investor to the United States.  Japanese businesses employ close to 1 million workers in the United States.  And investment from Japan to the U.S. can only increase upwards in the months and years to come.,And we wish to cement this win-win relationship.  Thank you.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I stand by my commitment to American workers.  I ca- — a man of my word, I’m going to keep it.  And with regard to that, I stand by our commitment to our alliance.  This is exactly what we’re doing — a strong alliance as well.,Q    Nakakuki of Kyodo News.  My question is to both Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden.  At the summit, you confirmed your strong objections against unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion by China and agreed on reinforcing response capabilities.,Under current circumstances, should Japan and the United States bolster defense capabilities?  China may become more preoccupied in military expansion and intensify its coercive behavior.  That is the risk of (inaudible).  In order to avoid divide and expa- — avoid the divide, how should Japan and U.S. respond?,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Let me then take that question first.  At this summit, we confirmed that the United States and Japan will resolutely defend and bolster a free and open international order based on the rule of law and that Japan and the United States, as global partners, shall work together for that purpose.,On challenges concerning China, including the point you raised on objecting to unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion, we concurred that Japan and the United States as global partners shall work in close coordination.,And also, as I said previously, we will continue our dialogue with China and we will cooperate with China in tackling common challenges.  And the President and I confirmed the importance of such dialogue as well.,Based on the solid trust with our ally, the United States, we will continue to call on China to fulfill its responsibilities as a major power.,Japan’s policy, which I have consistently embraced, is to comprehensively promote the mutual strategic relationship we have with China and establish a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship through efforts by both sides.  That has been my consistent position that I have upheld.  We will continue to seek close communication with China at all levels.,That’s it for me.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You know, first of all, we keep improving our lines of communications with one another — and that’s the United States and China.  We — I’ve met — I’ve recently spoken at length with President Xi.  And we’ve agreed that we would, number one, have personal contact with one another whenever we want to discuss to anything so there’d be no — nothing lipped — nothing slips between, as they say — between the cup and the lip, so we know exactly what the other team is thinking.  Number one.,And so, we had a long discussion last — now almost — I guess almost two weeks ago now.  And — the best way to reduce the chances of miscalculation and misunderstanding.  That’s number one.,Number two, in our alliance we have with Japan — is a purely defensive in nature.  It’s a defensive alliance.  And the things we discussed today improve our cooperation and are — and are purely about defense and readiness.  It’s not aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region.  And it — it doesn’t have anything to do with conflict.  And so, this is about restoring stability in the region.  And I think we have a chance of doing that.,Okay.  Third que- — the next question.  Who — who do I call on next?  Hang on a second.  I got my list here.  Hang on.  I apologize.,Aurelia of AFP.,Q    Thank you.  My first question would go to both of you, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister.  Is there a path for Japan to become a full member of AUKUS?,And I would have a second question for you, Mr. President.  You’re now saying that Benjamin Netanyahu is making a mistake in Gaza.  What are you willing to do to make him change his strategy?  And would you consider conditioning military aid to Israel?  Thank you.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you.  Your question about AUKUS, I will respond.  Our country — we want to contribute to the peace and stability of the region.  And therefore, we have consistently supported AUKUS.,Having said that, the participants of AUKUS — U.S., UK, Australia — with such countries’ bi- — bilateral relationship or in multilateral occasions, we have established various relationships.  But for Japan, to have a direct cooperation with AUKUS, nothing has been decided at this moment.,Going forward with U.S., UK, or with Australia — with such countries, in bilateral or multilateral frameworks, we will continue our cooperation so that they will continue to be considered.,At the moment, about the relationship between Japan and AUKUS, that’s it.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  With regard to my discussions with Bibi Netanyahu — Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as our relationship with Israel, I have been very blunt and straightforward with the Prime Minister, as well as his War Cabinet, as well as the Cabinet.,And the fact of the matter is that Bibi and I had a long discussion.  He agreed to do several things that related to, number one, getting more aid — both food and medicine — into Gaza and reducing significantly the attempts — the civilian casualties in any action taken in the region.,And thus far — and we — and it’s tied to the hostages.  There are a number of hostages that are being held by a — by the — Hamas.  And just yesterday, we were meeting with the Vice President and our National Security Advisor before that, and they — and there are American hostages as well.  And they know how committed we are — the whole team — to getting their loved ones home, and we’re not going to stop until we do.,The new proposal on the table — Bill Burns led the effort to — for us, and we’re grateful for his work — there’s a now — up to Hamas.  They need to move on the proposal that’s been made.  And as I said, it would get these hostages home where they belong but also bring back a six-week cea- — ceasefire that we need now.,And the fact is that we’re — they’re getting in somewhere, in the last three days, over a

made to me.,Okay —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  This will be the last reporter.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Mr. Shimizu, please.,Q    (As interpreted.)  Thank you.  Shimizu of NHK.  I ask the question to both of you.,As Prime Minister Kishida mentioned, the abduction issue of North Korea, I believe, was discussed.  Prime Minister, you have expressed your wish to have a direct engagement with Kim Jong Un.  But they say that abduction is already result, which means that they are refusing.  During the meeting, what did you tell President Biden about the outlook of a summit?  And what engagement did you ask President Biden?,President Biden, my question: What did you hear from Prime Minister Kishida?  And what is your observation and feeling, your President, with the nuclear missile issues?  What is your position?  Do you support the summit between Japan and North Korea?  Thank you.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  First of all, if I may start, regarding my summit meeting with President Biden about North Korea, including the missile and nuclear issues we have discussed, and regarding the increasingly worrying situation, we have agreed to continue a close coordination.,And on top of that, we concurred that the window of a discussion with North Korea is open.  And we discussed that Japan, U.S. — Japan, U.S., and ROK will continue to work closely together.,I also asked for the continued understanding and cooperation for the immediate resolution of the abduction issue.  And President Biden once again gave myself a very strong assurance regarding the recent announcement by North Korea.,I will refrain from commenting on each and every announcement by North Korea.  But as I have been mentioning repeatedly, based on the perspective that the establishment of a meaningful relationship between Japan and North Korea is in the interest of both Japan and North Korea and that it could be hugely beneficial to the peace and stability of the region, my policy is to aim for a summit meeting with North Korea to resolve various issues and will advise high-level consultation directly under my instruction.  And that remains unchanged.,That is my response.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We did discuss this issue.  We both agreed the DPRK must — must also address the serious human rights and humanitarian concerns of the international community, including the immediate resolution of the abduction issue.,But, you know, the Prime Minister has just spoken to the potential of what his plans may mean.  But welcome — I welcome the opportunity — we welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Korea.,As I’ve said many times, we’re open to dialogue ourselves at any time wi- — but without preconditions from the DPRK.,So, I have faith in the — in the — Japan.  I have faith in the Prime Minister.  And I think his seeking a dialogue with them is a good thing.  It’s a positive thing.,Thank you.,Q    Sir, on the issue of abortion —,Q    What will you do if Israel invades Rafah?,Q    On the issue of abortion, sir, what do you say to the people of Arizona?,MS.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,National Security Council,Via Teleconference,(April 10, 2024),3:05 P.M. EDT,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And thank you all for joining today’s background call to preview the bilateral meeting of President Biden and President Marcos of the Philippines and the historic trilateral summit of the U.S., Japan, and the Philippines.,As a reminder, today’s call is on background, attributed to senior administration officials.  The call is also held under embargo until 5:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time tomorrow.,By participating in today’s call, you are also agreeing to these ground rules.,On today’s call, we have [senior administration official].  And I will now turn the call over to [senior administration official] to kick us off.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you so much.  And thanks to all for joining us this afternoon.  I’m also pleased to be joined here in the room by several of my colleagues who’ve been formative to the preparations of both the bilateral meeting between the President and President Marcos and the first-ever trilateral U.S.-Philippines-Japan leaders’ summit that will take place tomorrow.  So you may also hear the voices of [senior administration officials] alongside me as we work through what we have to share with you today.,As you all know, we just concluded the meetings portion of the official visit with state dinner, during which the President is hosting Prime Minister Kishida of Japan here at the White House for nearly their dozenth meeting in the last two and a half years since Prime Minister Kishida took office,.  And at that visit, we announced a number of extremely consequential deliverables, ranging from the defense space to civil space to critical and emerging technologies, critical infrastructure, and people-to-people ties.,But this is really just kicking off what we see as a tremendous week for us and for the President’s Indo-Pacific strategy here at the White House.  Because tomorrow we will also be welcoming President Marcos of the Philippines and holding, as I said, the first-ever trilateral leaders’ summit between the Philippines, the United States, and Japan.,Since the start of this administration, President Biden has, of course, prioritized the reinvigoration of the United States’ greatest strength: our network of alliances and partnerships.  And in our view, there is nowhere that this strategy has yielded more success and bigger results than in the Indo-Pacific.,Today, you saw our Japanese allies consistently standing up and stepping up alongside us to modernize the alliance in ways that would have seemed impossible just three years ago.  And tomorrow, you will see another longstanding ally in the Indo-Pacific stepping up in a big way, who is now more closely coordinated than ever with the United States, and that is President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.,He’ll be here for the second visit to D.C. in just two years’ time.  And this is the seventh meeting with either President Biden or Vice President Harris, which is a sign of the very close relationship that we have built with President Marcos.,Our alliance with the Philippines is the oldest in the Indo-Pacific and has never been stronger, with deep people-to-people ties at its foundation.  And that, of course, includes the more than 4 million Filipino Americans who live in the United States and 400,000 Americans who live in or are visiting the Philippines at any given time.,Under President Biden and President Marcos, we’ve modernized the alliance to meet emerging opportunities and challenges.  And our defense and security ties continue to serve as a cornerstone of that alliance.  And in particular, we’ve added four new sites under the Enhanced Cooperation Defense Agreement and provided an additional $100 million in foreign military financing for the Philippines.,We’re also working together in a range of areas from economic growth to energy security to critical and emerging technologies to secure connectivity.  And you’ll see all of those areas on display tomorrow.,But beyond the bilateral relationship, we are also excited to launch at the leader level, for the first time, a brand-new format, and that is the trilateral that includes our friends in Japan.  That trilateral met for the first time at the national security advisor level last year, and our leaders are now taking it to new heights.  And you’ll see there a huge amount of work on display that covers areas ranging from energy security to infrastructure to critical and emerging technologies to maritime security.  And we’re excited for all that we’ll be able to share in those spaces.,Amongst the priority of deliverables that we’ll be unveiling tomorrow — which, as Michael noted, are embargoed until 5:00 a.m. in the morning tomorrow — we’ll be announcing an important set of new infrastructure projects known as the PGI Luzon corridor, the first-ever PGI corridor in the Indo-Pacific, which will connect Subic Bay, Clark, Manila, and Batangas in the Philippines to accelerate coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure projects, including ports, rail, clean energy, semiconductors, supply chains, and other forms of connectivity in the Philippines.,We will be holding events and setting up a steering committee to accelerate the work on this Luzon corridor, and the Development Finance Corporation will open its first regional office in the Philippines as part of this announcement.,Second, we’ll be making announcements in the space of Open Radio Access Network technology, where the U.S. and Japan, both governments and industry, will be providing millions of dollars in funding for O-RAN field trials and the support of an Asia O-RAN Academy in Manila to enable future commercial deployment.  And we’re working closely with the government of the Philippines to ensure that we can partner as a trilateral grouping to deploy secure, trusted ICT technology in the Philippines.,Earlier this week, you saw an important step in a coordinated Australia-Japan-Philippines-U.S. maritime cooperative activity.  We held a joint sail in the South China Sea, of course in a moment where the Philippines is facing enormous pressure from the PRC in that part of the region.,And you’ll see us making further announcements tomorrow with respect to our coast guard cooperation, our cooperation on the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief space, and in our military cooperation and capacity building.,All in all, particularly at this moment when, as I mentioned, President Marcos is coming under pressure from the PRC’s aggressive tactics in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, what you’ll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos, ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn.,I’ll hand to my colleague to say just a bit about what you can expect in the bilateral space from the President’s meeting with Marcos.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  I’m happy to add a bit on that.,So, President Biden and President Marcos will meet tomorrow.  They’ll discuss initiatives to enhance economic and energy security, bolster maritime cooperation, invest in critical infrastructure, and deepen people-to-people ties.,President Biden will also reinforce the ironclad U.S. alliance commitments to the Philippines.  And the two leaders will also discuss their shared commitment to democratic values, including respect for human rights and internationally recognized labor rights.,Now, this is the second time that President Marcos has been to the White House in his many years.  And the two presidents will mark the unprecedented strength of the alliance between the United States and the Philippines, and underscore the historic achievements in bilateral relations since they last met at the White House in May 2023.,In addition to some of the deliverables that [senior administration official] mentioned, I wanted just to add a few. You’ll see several U.S. companies announcing new investments in the Philippines tomorrow, including areas in undersea cables, logistics, clean energy, and also telecommunications.,You’ll also see some new announcements related to humanitarian assistance and disaster response, specifically located around the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites that [senior administration official] mentioned.  Including over the next year, you’ll see USAID in partnership with DOD launching a new initiative to pre-position humanitarian relief commodities for Philippine civilian disaster response authorities at EDCA sites.,In addition, you’ll see us working together to invest in people-to-people ties, and you’ll also see us do more on clean energy and critical infrastructure, especially the new initiative under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment that [senior administration official] mentioned.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  With that, we look forward to taking your questions.,MODERATOR:  Thank you, Moderator.  I think we’re ready to go into the Q&A portion.,OPERATOR:  Let’s go to our first caller.  Please go ahead.,MODERATOR:  Could you say the name of the person who’s going to ask the question?,OPERATOR:  Sure.  It’s Michelle Jamrisko from Bloomberg.,Q    Hi, everyone.  Thanks for doing this.  Just wanted to go off something Jake Sullivan said yesterday and we’ve heard from other U.S. officials as well, talking a lot about U.S. efforts to modernize the alliances and bringing in non-traditional allies.  So I’m wondering if you see the trilateral tomorrow as a sort of launching board for having other partners across Asia kind of join these sorts of formats.  And if so, who would be on that target list?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey, Michelle.  I’m happy to take that one.,You know, I think we see less that we are necessarily going to continue to expand ad infinitum any given trilat and more that each of these individual partnerships add some very special sauce to the broader mix of what National Security Advisor Sullivan has called an overlapping latticework of mutually reinforcing partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.,So you might think about the fact that, of course, we have a number of strong bilateral alliances like the one you saw on display with Japan today.  We’ve got more innovative groupings, like the Quad, which the President and National Security Advisor Sullivan raised to the leader level early in this administration.  You’ve got AUKUS, which is a newer innovation also during this administration.  And now we’ve got a number of strong trilateral relationships, including the U.S.-ROK-Japan partnership, which the President took to new heights at Camp David, and now this trilat with the Philippines.,So we don’t necessarily see that each one of these partnerships needs to expand further, but rather, each one needs to serve its purpose.  And part of what we’re excited about with tomorrow’s visit is that we do think there is a very clear purpose and a very clear agenda guiding this trilat.,OPERATOR:  Okay, moving on to Trevor Hunnicutt from Reuters.,Q    Hey.  Thanks so much for taking the question.  So will the President give a commitment to Marcos as far as the U.S. being involved in any defense that needs to happen around the Second Thomas Shoal?,And then, out of the outcomes of this meeting, should we expect trilateral joint military training, defense capacity building for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and anything on maritime domain awareness?  Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hey, Trevor.  I’ll kick off and pass to [senior administration official].,The President’s commitment to the Philippines and to President Marcos on South China Sea issues has been quite clear.  He has repeated many times that the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty applies to the South China Sea, including Philippines’ vessels that may be underway there, including its coast guard vessels.,So I think our declaratory policy, again, is crystal clear and has been consistent throughout this administration and, needless to say, has also held on a bipartisan basis.  And the Philippines is confident in that commitment.,When it comes to the maritime activities that you might see coming out of this, I’ll pass to [senior administration official].,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  Just to add on top of the comments you already made: Over this past weekend, the United States, Japan, the Philippines, and Australia held a joint naval patrol in the Philippines’ EEZ.  I think as National Security Advisor Sullivan said yesterday, you can expect to see more of that in the months ahead.,On top of that, we will be announcing tomorrow an upcoming coast guard joint patrol that will be taking place in the coming year in the Indo-Pacific.  That builds on the first trilateral U.S.-Japan-Philippines coast guard patrol that was held over the past year.  The U.S. Coast Guard will also welcome Philippine and Japan coast guard members onto a U.S. Coast Guard vessel during the patrol in the Indo-Pacific this year to further train and synchronize our work together.,And I think you can expect to see further announcements tomorrow around trilateral maritime training activities, including around Japan, and a trilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster response exercise to take place over the coming year as well.,OPERATOR:  Okay, moving on to Patsy Widakuswara.,Q    Thank you for taking my call.  Just to follow up on Trevor’s question: Do we have a clear guideline of which type of gray zone tactics are covered by the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty?,And then, if I may just ask for some clarity on what the President said earlier, where Japan, the U.S., and Australia will create a network of air, missile, and defense system.  Do we have a timeline of that initiative?  Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’m happy to take that one.  You know, the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty extends to armed attacks on Philippines Armed Forces, public vessels, or aircraft.  And as I mentioned earlier, that includes its coast guard, and that includes anywhere in the South China Sea.,So that’s the text of the treaty that governs our alliance.  It is quite similar to the text of other treaties that support U.S. alliances around the world.,And obviously, we continue to coordinate very closely the question of China’s so-called gray zone tactics, its coercive tactics, and what the implications of those might be.,On the question of the air and missile defense integrated networks: As the President mentioned earlier, this is a deliverable out of the Japan state visit which also includes Australia.  What we announced today is really a vision for a coordinated network of radars and sensors that will better integrate our ballistic and air defense capabilities around the Indo-Pacific.  And it’s probably a few years off that will involve considerable work amongst our three countries.  But we don’t have a framework for how we will pursue it, as well as a strong mutual commitment amongst these countries if this is something we want to accomplish together.,OPERATOR:  Okay, moving on to Morgan Chalfant from Semafor.,Q    Thanks so much for doing this.  I just had two questions.  First, on the announcements of investments in the Philippines and undersea cables and telecom, can you say which companies are making those?  And then also, I was wondering if there’s a specific timeline for the PGII corridor you mentioned.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So, on the secure connectivity piece, I think you mentioned a few different projects.  The first one you may have mentioned is a submarine cable project, which is an investment that was announced at the Japan state visit today.  That involves our Japanese friends plugging into an ongoing sub-cable project that is led by Google in the South Pacific.  The United States and Australia are already invested in that project, and we’re very gratified that the Japanese have decided to join us.,When it comes to PGI, you know, we do expect it will take some time for the full suite of investments that we’ve envisioned here to come to pass.  But as I mentioned, we’re standing up a steering committee of high-level U.S., Philippines, and Japanese government officials to ensure that we are steering private sector investment to exactly the types of projects that this corridor needs to improve, as well as bringing a full suite of U.S. government tools to bear.,Again, as I mentioned earlier, the U.S. Development Finance Corporation will be standing up an office in the Philippines to help to steer this work.  And the U.S. Trade and Development Agency has announced a number of new activities in the Philippines that will help to support it as well.,In addition to all of this, you may be tracking that Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo recently led a presidential trade and investment mission to the Philippines, which announced more than $1 billion in combined investments to promote the Philippines’ innovation economy, clean energy transition, and supply chain resilience.,So, suffice it to say that we take very seriously all of the work that we’re doing in the Philippines.  There will also be a number of announcements tomorrow by way of private sector investment in the Philippines that we’ll be announcing anew, and those will come from Meta, UPS, GreenFire Energy, and Astranis telecommunications satellites.,OPERATOR:  Okay, moving on to Michael Shear, New York Times.,Q    Hi there.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  Just wanted to follow up on the so-called gray zone (inaudible) that China has been launching against the Philippine ships.  Will that subject — do you intend that subject to come up during the bilateral or trilateral talks tomorrow?  And is there anything the United States can do or is planning on suggesting or talking about in order to try to mitigate those attacks, since they appear to be, by default, just below the level of what would trigger the (inaudible)?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, thanks, Michael, for your question.  So, we absolutely expect the South China Sea to come up in tomorrow’s trilateral meeting.  It is one of the reasons for the meeting, because we are very concerned about what we’ve been seeing.,We consistently condemn the use of coercive and unlawful tactics in the South China Sea every time they occur.  We do so via public statement and diplomatically.  There’s a strong record of U.S. statements on this issue, particularly in the last several months since the Philippines has been under increasing pressure.,You will also see in our trilateral joint statement some very strong language on our unity on the South China Sea.  And that language will make very clear that we have a combined position that supports the Philippines’ lawful operations and rights in the South China Sea and in particular in its own exclusive economic zone.  So we will be quite unified in that position.,Additionally, you know, many of the deliverables that we started to preview for you here today — whether that’s the recent joint sail that we just conducted on a quadrilateral basis in the South China Sea, the coast guard cooperation we’ll be undertaking, or new military exercises that we may conduct together — these are all intended to boost our cooperative capacity and, in particular, to make sure that our friends in the Philippines have the capacity that they need to be able to uphold international law in the South China Sea.,So this is a very common theme, if not a pillar, of tomorrow’s trilateral meeting.  And we’re really looking forward not only to making good progress as a trilat in private, but to announce publicly our next steps in support for the Philippines.,OPERATOR:  Our next caller, Phelim Kine, Politico.,Q    Good afternoon.  Yeah, just a quick follow-up on the Second Thomas Shoal issue, and that is that China is turning a deaf ear to all of the Biden administration’s protests about its behavior there.  What we’re seeing is we see the State Department issue kind of like a template press release, saying they should stop this; we have a mutual defense treaty.  And Beijing isn’t just responding; they’re actually amping up the pressure on the Philippines in terms of the intensity and the aggression of its response.,So, I guess, two-part question.  What are you hearing from China, from Beijing, in terms of why they’re pushing this at the Second Thomas Shoal at a time of a wider, quote, unquote, “stabilization” of the bilateral relationship?,And number two, what exactly can the U.S. do with Japan or with others to kind of make China back down or turn away?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks.  I’m not going to interpret the Chinese government’s motivation for its use of coercive tactics at this time.  We’ll simply say that all of the international law in this space is very clear that the Philippines is lawfully operating in its own exclusive economic zone, and there’s really no question about that.,To your question about, you know, what can we do beyond continuing to issue statements, I would note, first and foremost, that while, of course, it is very unfortunate that the PRC has continued to use coercive tactics, we do see that every time it does, an increasing number of supporters come out to stand behind international law in the Philippines.  I believe that the last time there was an interdiction of a Philippines routine resupply effort, as many as almost two dozen countries came out with both (inaudible) support.,But of course, we raise this diplomatically in private, including at the highest level all the time, including the President raised this with Xi Jinping when they last spoke and not only reiterated our alliance commitments, which are crystal clear, but made clear his concern about PRC actions around Second Thomas Shoal.,But finally, the point that I’ll make — and you asked the question of what more can the U.S. do — the United States can invite President Marcos to the White House tomorrow for a bilateral meeting and a trilateral leaders’ summit for the first time ever.  This is very clearly a purposeful signal of support and resolve to Marcos.  There will be a lot of discussions, again, that take place on this in private.  But this is an invitation to the President — from the President to a close ally that is intended to signal very clearly that we support the Philippines at this difficult moment.,OPERATOR:  Our next caller, Ken Moriyasu, Nikkei Asia.,Q    Thank you very much.  On the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief hub, I believe there was a similar proposal in the factsheet of the U.S.-Japan (inaudible).  Are they similar things?,On the Philippines one, I think you said it will be placed on the EDCA sites.  Does that mean they’re going to be on all nine bases or just a few of them?  And does this also mean that, in the Japanese case, they will be based on U.S. bases in Japan as well?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure, thanks.  Happy to take that.,I mean, our main point here is that these additional four EDCA sites that we and the Philippines agreed on when President Marcos was here last year really demonstrate the value of U.S. military and Philippine cooperation at these sites and elsewhere.,And the main point of these EDCA sites is to do a few things.  One is to help the military modernization of the Philippines, is to increase coordination between our two militaries and increase interoperability, and then it’s also to help facilitate humanitarian assistance and disaster response.,The Philippine government, of course, has done a lot in this area.  We’ve been working with them quite extensively over many years.  What I had mentioned before is that, over the next year, USAID will be launching a new initiative to pre-position humanitarian relief commodities.  I won’t get into which specific sites those will be located, but the intent of those commodities is to assist Philippine civilian disaster response efforts and to ensure that disaster response can get to Philippine citizens when it’s needed most.,OPERATOR:  Okay, let’s move on to Tetsuo Shintomi, Kyodo News.,Q    Hi.  Thank you for taking my question.  When the national security advisors of three countries had a meeting last year in Tokyo, they reiterated the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.  And they also discussed on East China Sea, on North Korea, according to the readout.,So will the three leaders’ discussion go beyond South China Sea?  Will they also discuss on Taiwan Strait or even broader region, including East China Sea and DPRK?  Thank you very much.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you very much.  We fully expect that the three leaders will cover the full gamut of Indo-Pacific security topics, including, of course, South China Sea, East China Sea, peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and the threat posed by the DPRK’s illicit nuclear and missile program.,And one of the things that I think binds this group of leaders together is they are very — have a common outlook as maritime democracies who see much of the challenges in the Indo-Pacific in the same ways.,So one of the strong bonds between them is not only their assessment of the risks that are posed in all four of these situations, but their belief that common cooperation can help to inject stability in all of these areas.  So I know that President Biden is looking forward to those conversations.,OPERATOR:  All right, and that brings us to the end of our Q&A.  I’ll turn it back

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,East Room,8:06 P.M. EDT,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Tonight, we celebrate the alliance between Japan and the United States.,And Jill and I are honored to have you all here, including so many members of the Japanese-American community.  And we’d like to extend a particular welcome to President Clinton and Secretary Clinton, who’ve joined us this evening.  (Applause.),Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Kishida — Kishida, thank you for looking forward to this visit for a while.  We’ve been anxious for you to come.  I’m delighted you’re here.  And, you know, even the cherry blossom bloomed early in anticipation of your — (laughter).  Well, they did, by the way.  They really did.,And all of us — as you all know, those blossoms are the first sign of spring has arrived, and they remind us that we can begin anew every year and tomorrow can be a better day than today. It’s a symbol of both our countries — what h- — what b- — what both our countries hold dear: new beginnings.,So, thank you, again, for being here.,And a few days after my inauguration over three years ago, I received a big, shiny, blue-and-red envelope covered with stickers on the envelope.  It was a big envelope.  And it was full of letters from an elementary school teacher in Japan who compiled them from her students.  She teaches children who stutter, like I did as a child.  And she wanted th- — me to know that when she told them — her class about — that I had a similar liability at the time, the kids lit up, smiling, and they said, “We’re the same.  We’re the same.”,Well, we are the same, Japan and the United States.  Many — we may be divided by distance, but the — generations after generation, we’ve been brought together — the same hopes, the same values, the same commitment to democracy and freedom and to dig- — dignity for all.,And today, without question, our alliance is literally stronger than it has even been.  This was both not inevitable, but it was also — the fact is that both the Prime Minister and I came of age as our countries were — as they came together.  We both remember the choices that were made to forge a friendship that were once only a devastating — a fight that existed before.,We both remember that hard work, what it has done to find healing, and where there was once such hardship.  We both remember Japanese and American people who not only brought us together but who brought us forward, transforming our relationship for better — from bitter foes to the best friends we could be.,Tonight, we pledge to keep going.  We stand at an inflection point where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of the future for decades to come, a future that the kids of our two families and children in all of our two countries will remember.,But I also know that Japan and the United States stand together — and everyone should know that as well — committed to each other and committed to keeping — building a future worthy of the highest hopes and — that — of our predecessors and our people have dreamed of.,Ladies and gentlemen, so please join me in raising your glass — and I don’t have a glass.  Neither do you.  (Laughter.),(An aide brings glasses for the President and Prime Minister.),There you go.  Do you have one for the Prime Minister?,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  Thank you.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Join me in raising your glasses to our alliance, to our friendship, and, in the words of those young students in Japan, to the same future we share.  Cheers.,(President Biden offers a toast.),AUDIENCE:  Cheers.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I turn it over to you, Mr. Prime Minister.,Thank you.,Mr. Prime Minister.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  Thank you.,Mr. President, Dr. Biden, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for hosting such a wonderful dinner and your warm welcome and hospitality.,Before I came here, my protocol staff told me that no one had ever complained that my speech was too short.  (Laughter.)  This is probably good advice.  So, I’ll keep my speech short.  (Laughter.),First and foremost, to be honest, my breath is taken and I’m speechless in front of such a huge number of prominent American and Japanese guests.  My wife, Yuko, also left breathless, just told me that it was hard to tell who the guest of honor is.  (Laughter.)  So, I was relieved when I was shown the seat right next to the President.  (Laughter.),Last year, President Biden and Dr. Biden visited my hometown of Hiroshima to attend the G7 summit meeting.  It is a little-known fact that the largest number of Japanese immigrants to the United States came from Hiroshima.  Many Hiroshimans headed to the United States to seek a new world, a better future, and greater heights.,Mr. President, I know that the late Senator Daniel Inouye was a good friend of yours.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  He was.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  His mother was also from Hiroshima.,Looking back at the long history of Japan and the United States, our predecessors have carved out the path in various fields, such as business, academia, art, and sports, traveling back and forth between the two countries.,“The Pacific Ocean does not separate Japan and the United States.  Rather, it unites us.”  These were the words that President Kennedy sent to Prime Minister Ikeda, also hailing from Hiroshima, at the state luncheon held at the White House about 60 years ago.,I like this line.  I — I use it so many times that my staff tried deleting it — (laughter) — whenever this phrase appeared on speech drafts.  However, there is nothing that expresses our relationship as visibly as this.  And never have these words been more relevant than today.  Japan and the United States are united than ever before.  (Applause.),I believe that the Pacific Ocean has brought Japan and the United States together and so close because of the pioneering spirit of those who came before us and frontier spirit that we all have in common.  The success of those standing on the frontier is not just because of their individual efforts but also the result of collective efforts as a team.  This hol- — this holds true even between nations.,Our joint efforts are (inaudible) indispensable for our bright future and for the peace and stability of the world.  We are now standing at a turning point in history, embarking on a new frontier and elevate this unshakable Japan-U.S. relationship to even greater heights and hand it to the next generation.,And, finally, let me conclude with the line from “Star Trek” — (laughter) — which you all know: “To boldly go where no one has gone before.”  (Laughter and applause.),By the way, George Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu, the helmsman of the USS Enterprise, also has roots in Hiroshima.  (Laughter and applause.),Mr. President, Dr. Biden, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen, I would like to propose a toast to our voyage to the frontier of the Japan-U.S. relationship with this word: “boldly go.”,AUDIENCE:  Cheers.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  Thank you.,PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Hear, hear.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  And “boldly go.”  Cheers.,(Prime Minister Kishida offers a toast.),PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Good job.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  Thank you.,8:17 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,New Department of Justice final rule sets strong standard for gun sellers who have to get a license and conduct background checks,Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a new rule that will save lives by reducing the number of firearms sold without background checks. This final rule implements the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act’s expansion of firearm background checks—the only significant expansion of the background check requirement since then-Senator Biden helped shepherd the Brady Bill over the finish line in 1993. This action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s strategy to stem the flow of illegally acquired firearms into our communities and hold accountable those who supply the firearms used in crime.,Statement from the President:,“I’ve spent hours with families who’ve lost loved ones to gun violence. They all have the same message: ‘Do something.’ Today, my Administration is taking action to make sure fewer guns are sold without background checks. This is going to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and felons. And my Administration is going to continue to do everything we possibly can to save lives. Congress needs to finish the job and pass universal background checks legislation now.”,Statement from the Vice President:,“Every year, thousands of unlicensed gun dealers sell tens of thousands of guns without a background check, including to buyers who would have failed one – domestic abusers, violent felons, and even children. This single gap in our federal background check system has caused unimaginable pain and suffering. Today, as the head of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, I am proud to say that all gun dealers must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell.”,The federal gun background check system is one of the best tools we have to keep guns out of the hands of individuals prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms, including domestic abusers and other violent criminals. But the loopholes in America’s background check laws have enabled domestic abusers, school shooters, violent criminals, and gun traffickers to illegally acquire firearms. Over the past 20 years, there have been numerous failed efforts to close these loopholes and expand background checks, including a bipartisan attempt in 1999 that followed the shooting at Columbine High School, and another bipartisan attempt in 2013 that followed the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.,In 2022, President Biden accomplished what many had tried for the past 20 years—he succeeded in expanding background checks by signing into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This law broadened the category of gun sellers required to become licensed dealers and run background checks. In 2023, President Biden signed an,Executive Order,to accelerate implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, including by directing the Attorney General to move the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation by clarifying the new Act. The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) final rule clarifies the type of conduct that requires a person to get a license to sell guns and to conduct background checks. By setting clear standards for when someone is dealing firearms, the rule provides the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) with proactive tools to enforce the law and keep our communities safe.,Background Check Loopholes Have Deadly Consequences,Since 1994, federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million individuals who are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. Despite the law, a growing number of unlicensed sellers continue to sell firearms for profit to complete strangers they meet at gun shows and online marketplaces, which has been a critical gap in the background check laws.,For the past 30 years, individuals who could not pass a background check sought out unlicensed sellers in order to evade the background check system. One investigation found that,1 in 9 people,who respond to online ads from unlicensed sellers would fail a background check. Tragic consequences of this unlawful conduct include:,Unlicensed dealers who do not conduct background checks are also,the largest source,of firearms that are illegally trafficked into our communities. In an assessment of its gun trafficking investigations from 2017 to 2021, ATF,identified,sales by unlicensed dealers as the most frequently used gun trafficking channel. Moreover, unlicensed dealers were the source of more than half of the firearms identified as having been trafficked during the five-year study period—a total of more than 68,000 illegally trafficked firearms.,Final Rule Implements New Law, Expanding Background Check Requirement to Tens of Thousands of Gun Sales,The Department of Justice’s final rule implements the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the largest expansion of background checks since the Brady Bill became law.,The final rule makes clear when a person needs to become a licensed dealer and run background checks, and gives the Department of Justice additional tools to crack down on individuals illegally selling guns without background checks. Specifically, the final rule:,There are over 80,000 licensed gun dealers in America. The Department of Justice estimates that there are over 20,000 unlicensed sellers who are selling firearms through online advertisements, gun shows, and other means. These unlicensed sellers should be licensed under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the new rule, and therefore conducting background checks. An alternative estimate based on survey data estimates that the new rule could affect gun sales being made by over 80,000 individuals. Legal limitations on tracking firearms make such estimates difficult to quantify.,Final Rule Builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s Commitment to Stopping the Illegal Flow of Guns,The Biden-Harris Administration has deployed a historic effort to partner with state and local law enforcement and keep communities safe by addressing the illegal sources of guns. The strategy is focused not just on the person who pulled the trigger of a firearm, but also on all of the links in the chain that led to the firearm being in the wrong hands, including the gun trafficker, the source of the gun trafficker’s firearms, rogue gun dealers who are willfully violating the law, and ghost gun manufacturers. Key Administration actions to stop the illegal flow of guns into our communities include:,Call for Congress to Act,Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is moving as close as possible to universal background checks without additional legislation.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Via Teleconference,THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Stef, for the introduction and for your longstanding leadership on the issue of gun violence.  And to everyone, thank you for joining.,So, I’ll start with this.  Every person in our nation has a right to live free from the horror of gun violence.  I do believe that.  And yet, today, one in five Americans has a family member who was killed by gun violence.,Today, gun violence is the leading cause of death for the children of America — not car accidents, not some form of cancer — gun violence.  And, you know, it — it just — it does not have to be this way.  It does not have to be this way.,We know how to prevent these tragedies.  And it’s a false choice to suggest that you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away.,I’m in favor of the Second Amendment, and I am in favor of reasonable gun safety laws — for example, background checks.,As the former district attorney of San Francisco, attorney general of California, and a United States senator, I’ve worked for years to keep our communities safe from gun violence.  And as vice president, I am proud that we have strengthened background checks by passing the first significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years.,And so, today, we build on that work by addressing one of the biggest gaps in the federal background check system: the so-called “gun show loophole.”  We’ve been talking about it for years.,Currently, gun stores are required by law to conduct a background check for every gun sale.  But, for decades, many dealers who sell weapons someplace other than the traditional gun store — say, for example, a gun show or a flea market or even through social media — have gotten away without conducting background checks.  This is the so-called “gun show loophole.”,Every year, thousands of unlicensed gun dealers send te- — sell tens of thousands of guns without a single background check, including to buyers who, if they had been required to pass a background check, would have failed — for example, domestic abusers, violent felons, and even children.,This single gap in our federal background check system has caused unimaginable pain and suffering.,Next week, our nation will mark 25 years since the tragedy at Columbine, a horrific act of violence that was carried out in part with guns purchased through the gun show loophole.,Since then, from New Paris, Ohio; to Chicago, Illinois; to Midland-Odessa, Texas, so many communities have been torn apart by acts of violence committed with weapons bought without background checks.,So, in the memory of all those we have lost, today, as the head of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, I am proud to announce that all gun dealers now must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell their merchandise.,In conclusion, I’ll say, in the years to come, I do believe countless families and communities will be spared the horror and the heartbreak of gun violence by this new rule.  And as we fight to keep our communities safe, President Joe Biden and I will continue to call on the United States Congress to have the courage to pass universal background checks, red-flag laws, and an assault weapons ban.,I thank you all.  And now I will turn it over to Attorney General Merrick Garland.,# # #,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",11-04-24,Press Call by Vice President Harris on Reducing Gun Violence and Expanding Background Checks,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/11/press-call-by-vice-president-harris-on-reducing-gun-violence-and-expanding-background-checks/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,U.S. Department of State,Washington, D.C.,12:54 P.M. EDT,SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Please — please be seated.  Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Kishida, Evan and I are so honored to join Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Emhoff in welcoming you to the State Department.,We’re delighted to be joined by a remarkable group of colleagues, friends, and dignitaries.,And a special salute to our colleagues from Congress who are here, who just witnessed your remarkable speech.  I think it may be, as well, the first time that anyone speaking before a joint session has managed to reference “The Flintstones.”  (Laughter.)  But more about that later.,Now, the very first time that the United States had the honor of hosting a delegation from Japan was in 1860.  Their journey then took three months to get here.  Upon arriving, they were received first at the White House, then the State Department for what, I’m told, was a boisterous dinner fueled by champagne, music, and dancing.  We’ll see what we can do about that.  (Laughter.),The Japanese delegation observed a debate in the United States Senate.  And at the U.S. Naval Observatory, they gazed through a telescope for their first-ever close-up view of the surface of the Moon.,From the time of that inaugural diplomatic mission, generations of Americans and Japanese have had their horizons expanded by the exchange between our countries.,Since Tokyo’s mayor donated the first cherry trees — we’ve heard a lot about cherry trees the last couple of days — to our nation’s capital over a century ago, their blossoms are a way that many of us mark the beginning of another spring, a reminder of our friendship and its immeasurable impact on our people and on the entire world.,I shared with the Prime Minister yesterday that people come from across the United States to Washington because of the cherry trees.  It’s a remarkable thing that this has become one of the most powerful symbols of our capital, and it’s thanks to Japan.,Over these past three years, we have invested tremendous energy into making this relationship between our countries even stronger.  We bolstered our security cooperation and increased our cooperation on renewable energy.  We’re deepening collaboration on artificial intelligence, on quantum computing, and on other technologies that will shape the 21st century.,Together with India and Australia, we’ve revitalized the Quad.,We’ve elevated trilateral cooperation with the Republic of Korea to unprecedented levels.,Today, we’re taking a similarly ambitious step with the Philippines.,We’re leading the G7 and meeting the fundamental challenges of our time, from helping Ukrainians defend themselves against Russia’s war of aggression to helping countries around the world build infrastructure vital to expanding opportunity.,We’re standing side by side in defending a free and open international order that, for decades, has bolstered our shared security and prosperity.,That we’ve done all this in partnership with a son of Hiroshima speaks to the spirit of healing and regeneration that animates this exceptional relationship.,Of course, the ties that bind us have been forged not only by our governments but, principally, by generations of Japanese and Americans from all walks of life.  And like the saplings that were brought here by the Prime Minister, these relationships took root, they grew, and they branched out in ways that were probably impossible to predict.,In 1872, it was an American schoolteacher who introduced baseball to Japan.  He taught at Kaisei Academy, the same high school where the Prime Minister would eventually play second base.  (Laughter.),Akira Kurosawa’s 1954 classic, the “Seven Samurai,” inspired one of our great Westerns, “The Magnificent Seven.”  Decades later, the American Best Picture “Unforgiven” was remade in Japan with the cowboy traded in for a samurai in Imperial Japan.,In 1963, a Japanese trade official named Kishida Fumitake was posted in New York City and brought along his then six-year-old son, Fumio.  The future prime minister later said that his struggles at that time to express himself in a new and unfamiliar language taught him, and I quote, “the importance of listening, especially to those whose voices often go unheard” and first inspired him to dream of a career in politics.,I think anyone who heard the Prime Minister speak last night at the White House and today before our Congress know how he’s mastered the ability to speak to people but also, based on what he says so clearly, to listen to them.  This is a man of not only extraordinary leadership but deep empathy that’s reflected in his leadership.,Not far from here, at the Smithsonian’s Modern Art Museum, the record for the two most popular exhibits are held by the same artist: Yayoi Kusama.  Many of you have seen these installations, her “Infinity Mirror Rooms,” where bright, glowing, polka dotted-cover — covered orbs seem to extend on forever.,Early in her career, Kusama wrote a letter to the great American painter Georgia O’Keeffe looking for advice.  She dreamed of moving to New York but felt daunted.  O’Keeffe wrote back to her, “Make the leap.”  Kusama did, and the rest is truly infinity.,These threads that connect our people, connect our cultures through time, they feel a little bit like Kusama’s installations — spreading with radiant, glowing ties as far as the eye can see, including into space, where we’re working together on everything from running an International Space Station to using the James Webb Telescope to better understand how our universe was formed in the first place.,And now, more than 160 years after that first Japanese delegation came to the United States and looked at the Naval Observatory through a telescope at the moon, we’ve agreed to be the first two nations to step foot on its surface together — and drive around on it, too.  We have a lunar rover that Japan is building, a model of which you’ll be able to see when you walk out of the State Department today.,So, please join me in raising a glass.  Thank you.,(An aide brings cups for the Vice President, Secretary of State, and Prime Minister.),Thank you very much.,To all the places we can imagine our extraordinary friendship will take us and even more to all the places we cannot even imagine in this moment going but where we know our determination, our innovation, and especially our friendship and cooperation will one day allow us to walk together.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  Cheers.,SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Cheers.,VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Well done.,SECRETARY BLINKEN:  And now, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great pleasure for me to hand the microphone over to someone who, as Vice President, made her very first trip — foreign trip in that capacity to the Indo-Pacific, someone who has been leading our efforts these past three years to deepen, to strengthen our ties to our most critical partners in the world.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice President of the United States.  (Applause.),THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, all, and good afternoon.,Secretary Blinken, Ms. Evan Ryan, it is yet again an honor for Doug and I to co-host this important luncheon with you and to welcome Prime Minister Kishida and Mrs. Kishida.,And welcome, again, to all of our distinguished guests.  I look around this room and I see extraordinary leaders of our two countries who are doing so much to lay the foundation and reinforce the work that we are doing at this level to strengthen the relationship between our two nations.  And I thank you for that.,Mr. Prime Minister, it is wonderful to welcome you back to Washington, D.C.  As President of the United States Senate, I also had the great honor of — of co-chairing your presentation to the joint session of Congress.  And you make quite clear that Japan will continue to be strong as a partner and a dear, close friend of the United States.,And Secretary Blinken mentioned that the Prime Minister made reference in his presentation to the joint session of “The Flintstones.”  (Laughter.)  Many of us will remember the cartoon.  I thought it was particularly poignant when he said but he’s not sure how to translate “Yabba dabba doo.”  (Laughter.),Mr. Prime Minister, we are so grateful for your commitment to our alliance.  And I will say as a proud daughter of California, I grew up surrounded by Japanese American culture and history — starting, of course, with learning about the Japanese emissaries who arrived in San Francisco in the 19th century, the first place that they visited in America, and, over the years, celebrating that history, be it in San Francisco’s Japantown in the Peace Plaza or in the Presidio, where in 1951, the Security Treaty was signed.,And in my elected career, as District Attorney of San Francisco, Attorney General of California, and a United States Senator, one of my dearest friends and advisors was Secretary Norm Mineta.,And as you may know, Mr. Prime Minister, because of Norm’s Japanese ancestry, he was forced into incarceration by the United States during World War Two, yet ultimately became one of the greatest statesmen of America.  And he fought throughout his career, understanding the importance of balancing and prioritizing both national security and what we must do in terms of civil rights.,And he showed us that from great pain can come great purpose and progress.  And in honor of your visit, we pay tribute to him with the establishment of the Mineta Ambassadors Program to increase student exchanges.,Mr. Prime Minister, I am incredibly proud of the purpose we share and the progress our two nations have made.  And as Vice President, it has been one of my great honors to help further to strengthen those ties.,You and I, as Secretary Blinken mentioned, first met in September of 2022 when I traveled to Tokyo to represent the United States at the funeral of Prime Minister Abe.  Prime Minister Abe was the author, of course, of the principle of a free and open Indo-Pacific.  And he invested in the U.S.-Japan alliance and set Japan on a course of global leadership.,Mr. Prime Minister, under your leadership, Japan’s global role has grown immensely and even further, and the United States and the Japan alliance is now stronger than ever.,During my trip to Japan, I flew south across the Tokyo Bay to a joint naval base where Japanese and American sailors train and serve side by side.  From the flight deck of the USS Howard, I had the honor of addressing hundreds of American sailors in dress whites, from which I explained the United States is a proud Indo-Pacific power, that the U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the region, and America’s commitment to Japan’s defense is ironclad.,And today, I will add the bonds between our nations and people are also ironclad.  Under your leadership, Japan has been an extraordinary partner to the United States.  In addition to Tokyo, you and I have met in Bangkok and Jakarta and here in Washington at the Vice President’s Residence — each visit building upon our contributions to global security and global prosperity, from maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait to trilateral cooperation with South Korea to the defense of rules and norms in the South China Sea, a dialogue which we will continue later today with President Biden and President Marcos.,We have worked together to advance investment research development for our semiconductors, resulting in strong supply chains and a strong American manufacturing industry.  And building on our first conversation 18 months ago, yesterday we announced that a Japanese astronaut will be the first international astronaut to the moon as part of our collaboration under the Artemis program.  (Applause.)  Yes.,Ultimately, I believe the U.S.-Japan alliance is a source of great strength for the United States militarily, economically, and culturally.  And it is a force for good in the world.,So, I will conclude where I began: my home state of California and Japan.  In 1964, as we know, while you were living in New York, as the Secretary just referenced, my beloved San Francisco Giants — (laughter) — called up a pitcher from the minor leagues.  And in September of that year, that player debuted at Shea Stadium in a Giants game versus the Mets, just a few miles from your school in Queens.,At that moment, Mashi Murakami made history as the first Japanese player to play a Major League Baseball game in America.  And I’m told he quickly instilled in you a love for baseball.,So, I will raise a glass to my beloved San Francisco Giants — (laughter) — and your Hiroshima Toyo Carp — (laughter and applause) — and all the enduring bonds between our nations.  Thank you.,(Vice President Harris offers a toast.),Thank you.  (Applause.),And now I present the Prime Minister.,PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  Thank you.  (Applause.),(As interpreted.)  The Honorable Kamala Harris, Vice President; Second Gentleman, Mr. Emhoff; Secretary Blinken, Secretary of State; Cabinet Secretary Ryan; distinguished guests, thank you for hosting this luncheon.,The script my staff drafted for this luncheon speech starts with the sentence, “Yesterday, I had a fruitful discussion with President Biden.”  Quote/unquote “fruitful discussion” is a cliché diplomats like to use.,When I was Foreign Minister, oh, did I hear that phrase over and over again until I almost got tired of it.  I also know that when a diplomat says, “Hmm, that’s interesting,” more likely than not, that person is thinking, “How boring.”,But there’s one thing I need to make clear.  Yesterday, President Biden and I literally had a truly fruitful discussion.  And I say “literally.”  (Applause.),The President and I reaffirmed the strength of the Japan-U.S. alliance.  I will continue to work closely with the President to actively contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity of the world we live in.,The success of the summit would not have been possible without the hard work by the Honorable Vice President, Secretary Blinken, and the collection of competent people on your team to whom we must thank with a great round of applause.  (Applause.),Let me quote a phrase in the Old Testament, Proverbs 27.  (In English.)  “Iron sharpens iron, so — so one person sharpens another.”,(As interpreted.)  “Iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.”  Ask an ex- — expert what this means, and you will be listening to a lecture until sunset.,I interpret this phrase to mean that when people with diverse values and ideas compete against and sharpen each other, something better is created.,That, indeed, is the force behind diversity — America’s strength that I encountered in New York in my childhood days — and is the power of Team Biden, I believe.,As I look back, when I was little living in New York, I feel that the philosophy and the words delivered vigorously by President Kennedy in his Inaugural Address most resonated among other grown-ups back then.  “We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.”  This is a passage from the Inaugural Address.,Because of this liberty, we are able to leverage diversity as the engine to drive ourselves forward.  Indeed, only because both Japan and the U.S. enjoy the liberty and are open and frank with each other are people successful in broad and diverse areas.,Just like yourselves here today, we’re able to overcome differences in opinions or positions.  We’re able to deepen mutual understanding and have produced the enduring power to advance the Japan-U.S. relationship forward.,Let us continue to do so as we have done so far.  But for the moment, just let us enjoy the lunch.,The unwavering Japan-U.S. relationship of today is all due to your passion and contribution.,Please allow me to take this opportunity to thank you all once again.  May I conclude my greetings by praying for the continued success of you all and for the further deepening of the Japan-U.S. relationship.  May I also raise a glass with you all.,Together, with myself, for the U.S.-Japan relationship and for a bright future of a relationship and for each and every one of you, please do continue your success and prosperity.,(Prime Minister Kishida offers a toast.)  (Applause.),END                1:08 P.M.

ever, to take on the climate crisis: roughly a trillion dollars — with a T — (laughter) — I had to — (laughter and applause) — over the next 10 years.  And that investment to create millions of jobs; to provide billions of dollars of clean energy money and investment to small businesses and entrepreneurs; to lower monthly energy bills for families across our nation; and to expand access to capital.,In every community in our nation, there are, of course, extraordinary people with talent, ingenuity, and the ability to help us take on the climate crisis: entrepreneurs, who I’ve met, who founded an innovative solar and wind power start-up that can help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions; in communities where there are small-business owners who help produce the batteries that power our nation’s fleet of electric vehicles; and, of course, community organizers that help millions of families make their homes more energy efficient to lower their energy bills.,But while every community has the capacity to join the clean energy economy, not every community has had the opportunity to do that.,As vice president, I have met with climate leaders from communities across our nation — from rural Arizona, to downtown Detroit; from Dalton, Georgia, to Denver, Colorado, to Durham.  And I can tell you that I have seen firsthand that in too many places, too many people with all of that talent there have still had limited opportunity to access to capital to do the work that they want to do to start and grow a clean energy business, to make their homes more energy efficient, or to install solar panels or EV chargers in their community.,So, I have fought for years with so many of you — we have fought together shoulder to shoulder — to expand access to capital for every community.  And as you heard, as a United States senator, I was proud to — to gain more than $12 billion, which we secured for our nation’s community banks.  And those are, of course, financial institutions which are run by folks who live, work, and invest in the communities they serve.,And then, as vice president, in 2022, I launched the Economic Opportunity Coalition, which is a coalition of banks, technology companies, and nonprofits, to invest billions of dollars in community banks from the private sector so they can make more loans under what we know to be circumstances where we’re looking at communities that have been underserved, including our rural communities.,And so far, the Economic Opportunity Coalition has invested over a billion dollars across our country.,And then, last year, we announced the largest investment in our nation’s history, $20 billion, to create a national network of nonprofits to expand access to capital for community-based climate projects — projects run by leaders from the community.  (Applause.)  Yes.  And the majority of this $20 billion will go to communities that have historically been left out and left behind.,And here is what is special about this announcement: For the first time in history, we are providing tens of billions of dollars directly to community lenders to finance local climate projects.,This is a novel approach.  It is actually the first time we have taken this approach, because we know that we have the capacity with this approach to empower communities to decide which projects they want, that will have the greatest impact from their perspective in the place they call home.  And then we can invest in those projects in a way that will actually have value for the people who live there, instead of us from Washington, D.C., telling you what you need.  (Applause.)  And that is critically important.,And so, today, our announcement is that we have chosen eight nonprofits to lead this work, from a community of — of banks that are a network that serve Native communities, to a rural economic development collective that works in Appalachia, to a group of lenders that focus on economic and climate justice.  Yes.,And this $20 billion investment will allow these eight nonprofits to fund tens of thousands of community-based climate projects.,So, I’d like you to imagine what this means.,Imagine, for example, the young entrepreneur who wants to launch a startup to repair electric vehicle chargers, and that this person can now get a small-business loan to hire her first employees.,Imagine a small-business owner who can now take out a line of credit to buy a fleet of electric delivery vehicles so he can stop paying for gas and reduce pollution at the same time.,Imagine a house of worship that can now get a zero-interest loan so they can install solar panels to generate clean energy through electricity for the entire neighborhood.,Our investment will also help lower energy bills for homeowners and renters.  When President Biden and I first ran for office, folks told us we — we have to take on the climate crisis and we have to also lower monthly energy bills.  Well, the investment we’re talking about today will do both.,For example, today, I visited Grier Heights — (applause) — and as many of you know, it is an his- — an historically Black neighborhood here in Charlotte.  And over the past two decades, the community bank Self-Help worked with residents and community organizations to install good insulation, high-quality windows, and new electric appliances in 49 homes in this part of Charlotte to make them more energy efficient.,So, earlier today, before I arrived here, I visited with one of those homes and met Levon, who is here with his two beautiful sons — (applause) — the baby, who is napping after our visit — (laughter) — and the older young leader’s son who was talking with me about how he was watching the Shirley Chisholm documentary.  And I told him I’m counting on his leadership.,And — and they were so kind to — to welcome us to — to visit with them.  Levon is a small-business owner and a former middle school teacher.  And — and he shared with me that last — in his last home, every month, he paid $300 for his gas bill and $300 for his electricity bill.,After moving into one of Self-Help’s energy-efficient homes, Levon’s total energy bill — total — dropped to around $100 a month.  (Applause.),And he offered to me what that meant for him as a young father of young children.  He said, well, that savings now allows him to have more money to pay for childcare.  He’s a small-business owner; he needs childcare for his children.  He said that he and his spouse now are putting aside at least $50 a month for each of their sons for their savings account for college or whatever they choose to do.,So, let’s think about what this means.  Yes, we talk about cutting energy costs.  But when we’re talking about real people with their dreams and aspirations and responsibilities and obligations, this is a big deal.,So, today’s investment will allow Self-Help and other nonprofits to help 30,000 more families across our nation upgrade their homes.  And that is just the beginning.,But think about it: Soon, 30,000 more families will have the funds they need to replace drafty windows and install better insulation to keep their homes warm in the winter and cool in the summer and, here in North Carolina, to help you lower that monthly Duke Energy bill.  (Applause.)  You’re welcome.  (Laughs.)  Right?,And just like Levon, 30,000 more families will now have the opportunity to save potentially hundreds of dollars every month and with more money in their pocket, then, for groceries and school supplies and childcare.,Our $20 billion public investment will also serve as an investment for the private sector.  And I met with the leaders of the eight non- — nonprofits before I came out to thank them.  Because over the next seven years, this $20 billion public investment will incentivize more than $100 billion in private-sector investing.,And I know, and I think everyone here knows, that there is great power in public-private partnerships, which demonstrate how much we can accomplish when we combine the experience and expertise of the private sector with the scale and capacity of government.,So, all of that being said, we also know that this investment is going to create jobs — good-paying union jobs; jobs for the workers of IBEW, who are going to install the energy-efficient lighting; jobs for sheet metal workers who can replace the dirty furnaces and — and replace them with clean electric heat pumps; and jobs for the laborers who will build affordable, energy-efficient housing.,So, I’ll conclude with this.  This investment demonstrates an important point: When we invest in climate, we create jobs, we lower costs, and we invest in families.,When we expand access to capital and give every person in our nation, no matter who they are or where they live, the opportunity to pursue their dreams, we build a cleaner, healthier, and more equitable and more prosperous future for everyone.,Thank you all.  (Applause.),May God bless you.  And God bless America.,Thank you.  Thank you.,END                2:44 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,We, the leaders of Japan, the Philippines, and the United States, met today for the first Summit between our three countries. As three Indo-Pacific maritime democracies, our nations and the half-billion people we collectively represent are bound together by historical ties of friendship, robust and growing economic relations, and a proud and resolute commitment to our shared fundamental values of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. We gather today in Washington as equal partners and trusted friends, united by the vision we share of a free and open Indo-Pacific and international order based on international law—a vision we pledge to advance together for decades to come. We believe, fundamentally, that by working together, we can advance the security and prosperity of our own nations, the Indo-Pacific region, and the world.,Our historic Summit today is the culmination of decades of partnership and builds on the recent momentum of our governments’ trilateral efforts. In June 2023, our national security advisors met in Tokyo, and again virtually in December 2023, to establish a common framework for trilateral cooperation among our nations. In July and September 2023, our foreign ministers met to advance our shared agenda on economic security, development, humanitarian assistance, maritime security, and defense. In September 2023, Prime Minister Kishida, President Marcos, and Vice President Harris met to deepen our trilateral cooperation. Following today’s Summit, we intend to further expand trilateral engagements across our governments and to intensify our cooperative efforts across sectors.,Our three nations share a firm commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that is connected, prosperous, secure, inclusive, and resilient. We welcome coordination and cooperation with a wide range of partners who share these goals. In that spirit, we affirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity, and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We underscore our support for Pacific Island countries and intend to transparently and effectively work in partnership with the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) to support the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Additionally, we welcome efforts to support a peaceful and stable, rules-based Indo-Pacific region, including from the Quad, AUKUS, and the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea trilateral framework.,Promoting Inclusive Economic Growth and Economic Resilience,Our three nations resolve to promote enduring, inclusive economic growth and resilience in our countries and the broader Indo-Pacific. We are pursuing economic projects that advance our shared objectives: promoting broad-based and sustainable economic growth, and investing in resilient, reliable, and diversified supply chains. We support the continued progress of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) to advance resilience, sustainability, inclusiveness, economic growth, fairness, and competitiveness for our economies and the broader region. President Marcos welcomes President Biden’s recent Presidential Trade and Investment Mission to the Philippines and the announcement of more than $1 billion in U.S. private sector investments that help promote the Philippines’ innovation economy, clean energy transition, and supply chain resilience, as well as the continued U.S. commitment to mobilizing private sector investment in the Philippines. President Marcos appreciates Japan’s contribution of Official Development Assistance and private sector investment in its 2022-2023 fiscal year, which exceeded the pledge of JPY 600 billion made in the 2023 Japan-Philippines Joint Statement. We welcome the first trilateral commerce and industry ministers’ meeting that took place earlier today to advance our shared agenda. Our three nations commit to facilitating the steady implementation of ongoing and future economic cooperation projects toward the Philippines’ attainment of upper middle income country status and beyond.,We express concern over and strongly oppose economic coercion, stress the importance of a rules-based economic order, and underscore the need for close coordination in dealing with economic coercion.,Announcing the Luzon Corridor,Our three nations are proud to partner on the first Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment corridor in the Indo-Pacific. Today we are launching the Luzon Economic Corridor, which will support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila, and Batangas in the Philippines. Through this corridor, part of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment-IPEF Accelerator, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States commit to accelerating coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure projects, including rail; ports modernization; clean energy and semiconductor supply chains and deployments; agribusiness; and civilian port upgrades at Subic Bay. Japan has long been supporting connectivity in this area, including rails and roads, through Japan International Cooperation Agency. We plan to work with multilateral organizations and the private sector to attract quality, transformative investments. Together we intend to hold a trilateral event promoting investment in the Luzon Corridor on the margins of the Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Manila in May—the premier U.S. commercial event in the region. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation also intends to open a regional office in the Philippines to facilitate further investments across the Philippines. The Luzon Corridor is a demonstration of our enhanced economic cooperation, focused on delivering tangible investments across multiple sectors. Japan, the Philippines, and the United States are also partnering to expand cooperation and investments in other areas of the Philippines.,Developing Critical and Emerging Technologies,We commit to harnessing the talents and ingenuity of our citizens to seize cutting-edge technological opportunities. The United States, subject to Congressional notification, and Japan, with support from Japanese industry, intend to provide at least $8 million for Open Radio Access Network (RAN) field trials and the Asia Open RAN Academy based in Manila, to enable future commercial deployment and an open, interoperable, secure, reliable, and trusted information communications technology ecosystem in the Philippines. This builds on prior U.S. and Japanese investment of over $9 million for these projects in the Philippines. The government of Japan is also seriously considering further investments for the potential commercial deployment of Open RAN technology in the Philippines, including from the Global South Future-Oriented Co-Creation Project. The United States and Japan welcome the Philippines’ plan to pilot Open RAN in its national broadband program and free Wi-Fi project. The United States and Japan commend the Philippines’ commitment to develop a national Open RAN policy framework, reaffirming the Philippines’ endorsement of open, interoperable, and trusted architectures. This year, our three countries look forward to holding the first trilateral Cyber and Digital Dialogue to explore additional cooperation opportunities.,We intend to pursue a new semiconductor workforce development initiative, through which students from the Philippines will receive world-class training at leading American and Japanese universities, to help secure our nations’ semiconductor supply chains. This initiative complements the expansion of semiconductor investments in the Philippines that would strengthen supply chain resiliency among our three nations. Furthermore, through the CHIPS and Science Act’s International Technology Security and Innovation Fund, the United States and the Philippines plan to coordinate our efforts to develop and expand the Philippine semiconductor workforce to strengthen the global supply chain.,Advancing Climate Partnership and Clean Energy Supply Chains,Recognizing the existential threat of the climate crisis, we affirm our commitment to take urgent action this decade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with a 1.5 degrees Celsius warming limit and accelerate efforts to build clean energy economies, while noting different national circumstances.,Our three nations seek to expand trilateral cooperation in the Philippines on the deployment of clean energy technologies, including renewable energy projects such as solar and wind, to support energy requirements in the Philippines and help ensure a just energy transition. We also welcome the first Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels on March 21, where participants from more than 35 countries, including Japan, the Philippines, and the United States, recognized nuclear energy as an important component of a multifaceted and inclusive clean energy transition. Recognizing the Philippines’ request for further training and capacity building for scientists, engineers, and relevant personnel and policy-makers, our three nations seek to expand our partnership on safe and secure civil-nuclear capacity building. Under the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program, the United States and Japan plan to co-host a nuclear energy study tour in Japan for nuclear experts and policy decision-makers from the Philippines and other FIRST partner countries. We also plan to deepen trilateral cooperation on civilian nuclear workforce development through a trilateral dialogue this year, to advance the Philippines’ civil nuclear energy program.,Japan, the Philippines, and the United States are working together to expand cooperation for the transition to clean energy and create high-standard, clean energy supply chain jobs across our three nations through the mutually beneficial development of resources in clear, transparent, and fair market competition with strong protections for labor rights and the environment. Japan, the Philippines, and the United States support critical minerals industries in all of our countries as a way to promote resilient and reliable global supply chains for critical minerals. We share the goal of producing and supplying battery materials and batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems for the global marketplace. The United States, under the International Visitor Leadership Program, plans to manage a clean energy supply chain training program for select participants from Japan and the Philippines. In addition, the United States and Japan look forward to the Philippines being a founding member of the Minerals Security Partnership Forum, which signifies an important step towards securing and diversifying our collective clean energy supply chains.,Partnering for Peace and Security,Today, President Biden reaffirms the ironclad U.S. alliance commitments to both Japan and the Philippines, which have helped safeguard peace and security in the Indo-Pacific for decades. We underscore our nations’ unwavering commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight, and the importance of respecting the sovereign rights of states within their exclusive economic zones consistent with international law, as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).,We express our serious concerns about the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) dangerous and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. We are also concerned by the militarization of reclaimed features and unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. We steadfastly oppose the dangerous and coercive use of Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels in the South China Sea, as well as efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation. We reiterate serious concern over the PRC’s repeated obstruction of Philippine vessels’ exercise of high seas freedom of navigation and the disruption of supply lines to Second Thomas Shoal, which constitute dangerous and destabilizing conduct. The final and legally binding July 12, 2016 Arbitral Tribunal determined that this feature lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, and we call on the PRC to abide by the ruling.,We express our serious concerns regarding the situation in the East China Sea, and reiterate our strong opposition to any attempts by the PRC to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea, including through actions that seek to undermine Japan’s longstanding and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands.,We affirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity, recognize that there is no change in our basic positions on Taiwan, and call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.,We welcome recent cooperation among our three nations in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific and commit to deepening that cooperation. The U.S. and Japan continue to support Philippine Coast Guard capacity building, including through Japan’s recent provision of twelve Coast Guard vessels and plans to provide five additional vessels to the Philippines.  Following the first-ever joint exercise between our coast guards in 2023, the United States looks forward to welcoming Philippine and Japan Coast Guard members onto a U.S. Coast Guard vessel during a patrol in the Indo-Pacific this year. Within the next year, our coast guards also plan to conduct an at-sea trilateral exercise and other maritime activities in the Indo-Pacific to improve interoperability and advance maritime security and safety. We announce the establishment of a trilateral maritime dialogue to enhance coordination and collective responses to promote maritime cooperation. We are concerned about illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. We support the ability of Filipino and Japanese fisherfolk to pursue their traditional livelihoods. To build regional capacity and address threats posed by transnational crime, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and other maritime challenges, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States plan to expand our efforts to provide maritime law enforcement training and support to partner countries in the region.,Our three nations pledge to strengthen our extensive coordination to promote maritime domain awareness and deepen cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. We emphasize our commitment to advancing multilateral maritime domain awareness cooperation through such venues as the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA). We intend to identify and implement opportunities for combined training with Southeast Asian regional partners. We are also launching a Japan-Philippines-U.S. humanitarian assistance and disaster response exercise, which could be integrated into trilateral or multilateral activities, including Balikatan 2025, to ensure our countries are ready and able to work together seamlessly and expeditiously in response to any crisis or contingency. We resolve to advance trilateral defense cooperation, including through combined naval training and exercises between our three countries and additional partners, such as the recently concluded Maritime Cooperative Activity between Japan, the Philippines, the United States, and Australia, and by coordinating U.S. and Japanese support for Philippine defense modernization priorities. We plan to conduct a maritime training activity around Japan in 2025. Japan also continues to contribute through its new “Official Security Assistance” cooperation framework.  The U.S. and the Philippines welcome Japan’s revision of the Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and its Implementation Guidelines, which bolsters cooperation through joint development and production to enhance our deterrence capabilities in the region. The U.S. and Japan also welcome the growing defense cooperation between Australia and the Philippines and between the Philippines and the Republic of Korea.,Our three nations affirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and strongly condemn the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) escalatory threats and unprecedented number of ballistic missile launches, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile launches, which pose a grave threat to peace and security. We emphasize the importance of addressing the human rights and humanitarian concerns of the international community, including the immediate resolution of the abductions issue. We strongly urge the DPRK to comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and refrain from continued development, testing, and transfer of ballistic missiles to any country, including Russia, which has used these missiles against Ukraine. We assert that these DPRK actions have severe security implications for the Indo-Pacific and European regions. As we continue to affirm our commitment to international law, including the United Nations Charter, we reiterate our unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. To that end, we recall the United Nations General Assembly resolutions stating that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. Russia’s threats of nuclear weapon use in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are unacceptable, and we state unequivocally that any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would be completely unjustifiable.,We reaffirm our joint pursuit of a world without nuclear weapons, with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as its cornerstone, and call on nuclear weapon states to promote stability and transparency, and engage in substantive dialogue on reducing nuclear risks. As founding members of the “FMCT Friends,” we also call for the immediate commencement of long-overdue negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.,We are committed to championing gender equality and the rights of women and girls in all their diversity. In this regard, we commit to strengthening the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda. We highlight the leading role of women in preventing violent conflict, delivering relief and recovery efforts and pledge to advance the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace and political processes. We welcome the Philippines hosting an International Conference on Women, Peace, and Security in October this year, to review global implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 ahead of its 25,th,Anniversary in 2025.,Finally, we underscore the importance of strong democratic institutions, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, gender equality, and human dignity. We represent proud, resilient democracies, mindful of our respective challenges but determined to overcome them, and we remain committed to safeguarding the human rights, media freedom, and labor rights of our people. These democratic values form the very foundation of our bilateral relationships and this trilateral partnership. These ideals have helped us build and sustain the mutual trust between us as leaders and between our people. United by these shared values, we commit to continuing our work together to address the consequential issues of our time, and to build a better future for future generations across our nations, the Indo-Pacific, and the world.,A new trilateral chapter between our three nations begins today.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",11-04-24,"Joint Vision Statement from the Leaders of Japan, the Philippines, and the United States",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/11/joint-vision-statement-from-the-leaders-of-japan-the-philippines-and-the-united-states/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Maryland Transportation Authority,Baltimore, Maryland,3:21 P.M. EDT,THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Please, please. Thank you.,By the way, folks, I say to my dad: Dad, they’re mispronouncing,Baltimore,. (Pronounced in an accent.) (Laughter.) My dad and the Biden — please, sit down — the Biden family goes all the way back to being watermen in this bay for a long, long time back in the la- — mid-1800s. And my father was born and raised here in Baltimore. And there’s a strong, strong connection. Still have family in the region as well.,Governor Moore, Senator Cardin, Senator Van Hollen, Congress[man] Mfume, Mayor Scott, County Executive Johnny O. — (laughter) — I like that — Johnny “O-ho-ho” — (laughter) — to all the military members and first responders and, most importantly, to the people of Maryland, I’m here to say: Your nation has your back, and I mean it. Your nation has your back. (Applause.),And you’ve got, without exaggeration, one of the finest delegations in the Congress of any state in the Union. And they know how to get things done, and we’re going to get this paid for. Aren’t we?,PARTICIPANTS: Yes.,THE PRESIDENT: All right. I was just briefed by the United — Uni- — Unified Command about the ongoing impact of this tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge last Tuesday.,The damage is devastating, and our hearts are still breaking. Eight — eight construction workers went into the water when the bridge fell. Six lost their lives. Most were immigrants, but all were Marylanders — hard-working, strong, and selfless.,After pulling a night shift fixing potholes, they were on a break when the ship struck.,Just seconds before, one of the men named Carlos, who was only 24, left a message for his girlfriend. Here’s what it said: “We just poured cement, and we’re waiting for it to dry,” he said.,Well, to all the families and loved ones who are grieving: I’ve come here to grieve with you. We all are.,It’s not the same, but I know a little bit about what it’s like to lose a piece of your soul — to get that phone call in the middle of the night to say family members are gone. I’ve been there. It’s feeling like having a black hole in your chest, like you’re being sucked in, unable to breath. The anger, the pain, the depth of the loss is so profound.,And we know it’s hard to believe, and you’re probably not going to believe me, but I can tell you now from personal experience: The day is going to come when the memory of your loved one, as you walk by that park or the church or something that you shared together, it’s going to bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye.,It’s going to happen. It’s going to take a while, but I promise you, it will happen. And that’s when you know you’re going to be able to make it. I promise you it will come. And our prayers for you is that time comes sooner rather than later — but it will come.,We’ll also never forget the contributions these men made to this city. We’re going to keep working hard to recover each of them.,And, you know, my vow is that we will not rest, as Carlos said, until the cement has dried on the entirety of a new bridge — a new bridge. (Applause.),Earlier this afternoon, we took an aerial tour to survey the wreckage. You know, from the air, I saw the bridge that’s been ripped apart. But here on the ground, I see a community that’s been pulled together.,I want to thank you all — the first responders, the port workers, state and local officials — who sprang into action before dawn, who’ve been here ever since.,And we did talk at, I think it was, 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. You were out here. You were here.,Within minutes of the collapse, the U.S. Coast Guard arrived on the scene. Within hours, I ordered personnel from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Navy, the Department of Transportation to assist in every way possible.,Within a day, we stood up a Unified Command.,In the weeks to come, I want you to know: We’re going to continue to have your backs every step of the way. I guarantee you. I guarantee you.,First — our first is our priority to reopen the port. This is one of the nation’s largest shipping hubs. And it’s the top port in America both in importing and exporting of cars and light trucks — the number one.,Simply put: The impact here has a significant impact everywhere — up and down the coast and around the country.,Thousands of tons of mangled steel remain lodged in the water, blocking ships from moving in and out of the harbor.,I’ve dec- — I’ve directed the Coast Guard, the Navy, and the Army Corps of Engineers — who are, by the way, the finest engineers in the world — and the state officials to work together to help remove this steel as quickly as possible and as safely as possible.,So far, our team has been able to clear two small channels for essential ships helping clear the wreckage.,And, yesterday, the Army Corps announced that by the end of April they will be able to open the third channel for some commercial traffic, including car carriers. And by the end of May, we’ll open the full channel — the full channel. (Applause.),My task force on Supply Chain Disruption has been able to — been engaging with union, rail, trucking, shipping, state and local leaders to minimize the impact on our supply chains.,And I’m proud to announce that the federal government will provide over $8 million in grant funds to make the infrastructure improvements at Sparrows Point, as the only [part of the] port unaffected by this collapse, which will allow Sparrows Point to take on more ships. And that’s happening now — will happen shortly.,Second, we’re focusing on protecting the workers and businesses. Folks, 20,000 jobs depend on this port. Twenty thousand families depend on this port to buy groceries, to make rent, to pay their bills.,Today, my administration is announcing the first tranche of Dislocated Worker Grants — fancy phrase to — which is dimed — all of it is there to make sure it — it helps create jobs for workers involved in the cleanup of this incident — additional jobs.,My Small Business Administration has also issued a disaster declaration, which will allow the SBA to offer low-interest loans for small businesses impacted by the collapse in order to keep things moving.,The state, the city, the county are also stepping up in impressive ways to help workers and businesses who have been affected by this disaster.,But, folks, we all need to step up. Amazon, Home Depot, Domino Sugar, and many other companies all rely on this port. And they have committed to keep workers and payrolls on their — and their businesses in Baltimore,and,[as we] move as quickly and clearly as possible to clear the channel. (Applause.),I’m calling on every company at and around the port to do the same thing — the same exact thing: commit to stay.,And to the customers who use this port, we’re coming back, and we’re coming back soon.,Folks, finally, we’re going to move heaven and earth to rebuild this bridge as rapidly as humanly possible. And we’re going to do so with union labor and American steel. (Applause.) For a simple reason: They’re the best workers in the world, and that’s not hyperbole.,Every day, over 30,000 vehicles traveled across this bridge, and I was one of those people. I commuted every day from Delaware for 36 years year to Washington, D.C., back and forth, and about one fourth of that time by automobile. I’ve been to every part of this port.,Folks, we now face a question no American should ever have to ask: How will I get to work? How will I go to school? How will I get to a hospital?,A response — in response, everyone, including Congress, should be asking only one question, and they’re going to be asked the question by your delegation: How can we help? How can we solve that problem?,My administration is committed — absolutely committed to ensuring that the parties responsible for this tragedy pay to repair the damage and be held accountable to the fullest extent the law will allow.,But I also want to be clear: We will support Maryland and Baltimore every step of the way to help you rebuild and maintain all the business and commerce that’s here now. (Applause.),As the governor — as the governor can tell you, within hours of the American req- — the Maryland request, we approved $60 million in emergency federal funding. I fully intend — I fully intend, as the governor knows, to have the federal government cover the cost of rebuilding this entire bridge — all of it — all of it — (applause) — as we’ve done in other parts of the country in similar circumstances.,And I stand here, I call on Congress to authorize this effort as soon as possible.,Let me close with this. This port is over 300 years old. As a matter of fact, as I said, my great-great-grandfather worked here as a waterman in this bay. This port is older than our Republic. And it’s been through tough, tough times before.,During the war of 1812, a young Marylander named Francis Scott Key, to whom the bridge is named after, sat in a boat in this very harbor, and he watched — he watched the British troops launch an attack after attack on American forces.,But as the dawn broke, we saw the American flag still flying, Baltimore was still standing, and our nation, as he wrote in the “Star-Spangled Banner,” had made it through a perilous fight.,Folks, this is going to take time, but Governor Moore, Senator Cardin, Senator Van Hollen, Congressman Mfume, Mayor Scott, County Executive Johnny O., and others are going to rebuild this bridge as rapidly as possible. And, folks, we’re determined to come back even stronger.,We’re the only nation that has gone through every crisis that we’ve had — we come out stronger than we went in. And we’re going to do it here as well. And once more to make this perilous challenge — this perilous challenge.,You know, because we’re the United States of America, there’s nothing — nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Think about that. Remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. Nothing is beyond our capacity.,May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops, our first responders, and all those who gave their soul.,Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.),3:33 P.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",05-04-24,"Remarks by President Biden on Rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge and Reopening the Port of Baltimore | Baltimore, MD",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/04/05/remarks-by-president-biden-on-rebuilding-the-francis-scott-key-bridge-and-reopening-the-port-of-baltimore-baltimore-md/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Yesterday, as part of President Biden’s historic climate agenda, Vice President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan,announced $20 billion in awards to expand access to clean energy,and climate solutions and lower energy costs for communities across the nation. This investment, made possible by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, will stand up a first-of-its-kind national network that will finance tens of thousands of climate and clean energy projects across the country, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities.,Leaders from across the country praised the announcement. Here’s what they’re saying:,Environmental Leaders,Ben Jealous, Executive Director, Sierra Club:,“Today’s announcement is a game-changer in ensuring meaningful clean energy and clean technology investments are possible in every community in America — particularly in low-income communities, communities of color, and areas that far too often are overlooked. By making this kind of capital available, the Biden-Harris administration is showing that a clean energy future that puts people first is a reality that is within our grasp. This is another major victory for President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and one of the many reasons the Sierra Club fought so hard to make this law a reality. I thank Vice President Harris and Administrator Regan for their continued work in implementing this landmark law.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Margie Alt, Director, Climate Action Campaign,: “We congratulate the EPA and today’s awardees. These funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) will be put to work across the country to fight climate change in our communities, including in our own backyards. This program will provide funding for important projects to combat climate change, reduce pollution, help accelerate our transition to a clean energy economy, and create new jobs. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is an example of the impactful, forward-thinking investing that Americans want and that President Biden, EPA Administrator Michael Regan, and the Democrats in Congress have delivered. This is smart investing in people who are close to the problems and can implement appropriate solutions that cut costs, save energy, and propel us toward a clean energy future.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Manish Bapna, President and CEO, Natural Resources Defense Council:,“This is an unprecedented investment in communities that have been overlooked for far too long. Neighborhoods and regions around the country are primed to see significant benefits; from new jobs and business growth to notable energy savings, putting money back in the pockets of hard-working people’. It’s a sizeable down payment on cleaner air, improved livelihoods and a safer climate.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Maite Arce, President and CEO, Hispanic Access Foundation:,“Addressing air quality is a matter of public health and economic strength. Recent decades have seen a rise in pollutants, affecting all Americans, with profound impacts on Latino communities facing socioeconomic challenges. The deterioration of air quality over the last century presents undeniable challenges, impacting public health, and economic stability. These issues hit hardest in vulnerable communities, including many where industry and agriculture, vital sectors of our economy, are integral. In terms of health, children, seniors and people with chronic illnesses are suffering from health conditions, such as heart disease, aggravated asthma and decreased lung function exacerbated by polluted air. Economically, Latinos are often faced with financial strain as they try to address these health conditions at clinics and hospitals.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Trevor Higgins, Senior Vice President for Energy and Environment, Center for American Progress: “,The administration today is standing up major new investment programs to make climate and clean energy projects a reality for communities across the country. These awards offer dedicated funding for the underserved and low-income communities that need it most. House Republicans voted countless times in a futile attempt to block this funding from being put to good use, but the Biden administration has now moved this vital program beyond the reach of partisan politics. It will fund programs that have the flexibility and permanence to deliver on the benefits of the clean energy economy for years and years to come.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Matthew Davis, Vice President of Federal Policy, League of Conservation Voters:,“The Biden-Harris administration is continuing to deliver on their promise to accelerate our country’s progress towards a clean energy future and ensure that a healthier, more prosperous future benefits communities previously left out…these investments from the historic Inflation Reduction Act will jumpstart local projects and help cut energy costs for families, create clean energy jobs, and decrease pollution in communities disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis and volatile fossil fuel prices. We look forward to these investments catalyzing building energy efficiency and clean energy projects on the ground and are thrilled that over half of these projects will go to historically excluded communities, including communities of color, communities with low wealth, and rural communities.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],LaTricea D. Adams, Founder, CEO, and President, Young, Gifted & Green, and White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council Appointee:,“This announcement is a game-changer for communities that have historically been left behind and burdened by pollution. By targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities, this funding will not only reduce harmful climate pollution but also improve air quality, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs. It is a testament to the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to equity and environmental justice.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Estefany Carrasco González, Senior Director, Chispa:,“Chispa is excited to welcome the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund investments. These will address critically needed green energy funding for our communities of color that need it most, resulting in cleaner air, lower energy costs for all, and more local jobs. With local improvements such as community-owned solar, small business loans for local employers to electrify their vehicles, and home loans for families to improve their home’s comfort and energy efficiency, we’re starting to see an inclusive green energy future for all as a reality.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Rev. Susan Hendershot, President, Interfaith Power & Light:,“The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), established by the Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, will provide critical funding to create jobs, reduce pollution, and lower energy costs for families. This funding represents an important step forward toward a more equitable clean energy future by ensuring that two-thirds of this funding is directed to communities that have historically struggled to gain access to capital. Interfaith Power & Light celebrates today’s announcement and the efforts by the Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to invest in protecting our communities and our Sacred Earth.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Rev. Dr.,Ambrose Carroll, Founder, Green the Church:,“We celebrate the announcement of the awardees for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). Our communities across the country are going to receive an infusion of investments helping to accelerate the transition to clean energy in their homes, towns, and businesses, fueling economic opportunity and job creation, and revitalizing communities across the country, especially in places that have long been neglected. The GGRF builds on the successful track records of green and community-based lenders across the country and will provide federal funding to help scale projects that push us closer to a pollution-free nation. This announcement is especially important for African American congregations and communities historically overburdened by pollution. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is one way the Biden administration is meeting its commitment to the Justice40 principles, and Green the Church is grateful to the EPA for such action!” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Reed Hundt, CEO and Co-Founder, Coalition for Green Capital,: “The EPA’s awards of $20 billion compose the largest single capitalization of green banks in any country in the world. The United States now can lead all nations in showing how public-private investment can deliver cheap clean power faster than anyone has predicted – and can focus this new investment primarily on transforming the power platform in every low-income and disadvantaged community. With our pipeline of more than $30 billion in demand for public capital, we at CGC look forward to partnering with the agency, with other award winners, and with all other community lenders that either did not apply for funds or were not selected. Five billion dollars in capitalization is a really good start.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Andrew Reagan, Executive Director, Clean Energy for America:,“The Biden Administration is cutting pollution and bringing new jobs and consumer savings right where it’s needed most, thanks to today’s announcement. Delivering on their commitments, $14 billion dollars is going to low-income and disadvantaged communities, to help them make the switch to cost-saving clean energy. It’s more proof that we can and must decarbonize our economy in an equitable way that benefits all Americans. The Biden administration’s continued commitment to clean energy will help communities across the country. The Inflation Reduction Act will continue to advance local climate solutions. And today’s announcement will cut carbon pollution, save people money, and create good-paying clean energy jobs nationwide.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Kate Wright, Executive Director, Climate Mayors:,“Equitable access to clean and affordable energy is foundational to a sustainable future for cities. This unique fund will allow cities to fully leverage community and private sector partnerships to make historic strides in creating green jobs, reducing air pollution and lowering energy bills for residents. We thank the Biden Administration for making that a possibility, and providing an additional tool to help our Mayors continue to lead the way towards a brighter future.’” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Christian Brock, CEO, Elected Officials to Protect America:,“No one should have to suffer the injustice of living on the frontlines of the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) recognizes the power of federal funding to ensure worthy projects are scaled up to levels where their impact can make major differences for communities across the country who for far too long have been neglected. Elected Officials to Protect America is grateful and excited to see the GGRF empower leaders in Justice40 communities to create economic opportunities with good paying jobs, while transitioning to a clean energy economy for all.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Jessica Buendia, VP of Sustainability and Green For All National Director, Dream.Org,: “Dream.Org commends the Coalition for Green Capital (CGC) on their $5 billion award to create a national green bank. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, we have worked with the EPA, our partners, and thousands of supporters to shape GGRF programs to center disadvantaged communities. We will continue to work together to prioritize community engagement and technical assistance in this next phase of implementation. Today marks the beginning of a new era for climate finance where communities most impacted by climate change will finally have access to the financing they need for the solutions they deserve. Our vision is for this funding to flow to Black and Brown communities and through minority-owned businesses to create unprecedented work and wealth opportunities that create a greener world for all.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Deneine Powell, Executive Director, Urban Sustainability Directors Network:,“Sustainability, climate resilience, and equity are the pillars of a future where every community can thrive. Through the EPA’s greenhouse gas reduction grant competitions, we are leveling the playing field and ensuring that support and energy equity reach those most vulnerable to climate change. This announcement marks a critical step towards empowering communities nationwide, fostering partnerships that drive innovation in green technology, and securing a healthier, more sustainable environment for all.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Byron Gudiel, Executive Director, Center for Earth Energy and Democracy (CEED):,“It’s encouraging to see these vital Justice40 investments get to disproportionately  overburdened communities from around the country to support pollution-free energy and climate projects. This is only the beginning. We hope EPA continues to work with awardees to create robust community engagement processes, provide clear information on their decision making processes and most importantly deliver direct benefits to environmental justice communities. We look forward to seeing the recipients of the GGRF $7 billion Solar for All competition awards.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Justin Balik, State Program Director, Evergreen Action,: “We are thrilled to see the awards announced today are headed to recipients poised to build a clean energy lending ecosystem that will support deployment across the country for years to come. $20 billion in awards is already a major investment, but it’s only a fraction of the impact that these programs will have, as the green banks and investment funds awarded today stand up new revolving finance supports that attract even more private capital. This initial investment to fund future clean energy projects will be felt well beyond the 10-year window that applies to most IRA programs. By focusing on communities that have been historically locked out of traditional financing pathways and giving communities the flexibility to design projects that meet their unique needs, these funds will fill in the gaps left by the private sector and allow for creativity in tackling our biggest sources of climate pollution.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Kate Johnson, Head of U.S. Federal Affairs, C40 Cities,: “The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is a historic opportunity to invest in communities and create a cleaner and more just energy system for all. Cities are uniquely positioned to ensure that the projects funded by GGRF recipients deliver the maximum benefit to people on the ground – cleaner air, good paying jobs, and lower energy bills. C40 applauds the EPA’s action, and encourages all GGRF recipients to partner with mayors to advance transformative, community-driven projects that will improve people’s lives.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Antonieta Cadiz, Deputy Executive Director,,Climate Power En Acción,: “Today’s announcement will help people get the resources they need to make a difference in their communities. President Biden’s clean energy plan is already creating new opportunities across America, and there is so much more work to be done. Today’s awardees have the deep knowledge and experience to bring the clean energy future to life, particularly in low-income, Black, and brown communities — those who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. President Biden knows that the climate crisis has disproportionately affected marginalized communities, and their leadership is crucial to right the wrongs of historic environmental injustice and inaction. The investments announced today will bring cleaner air, lower energy costs, and quality jobs to the communities most impacted by the toxic legacy of corporate polluters.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Maggie Monast, Senior Director for Climate-Smart Agriculture, Environmental Defense Fund:,“Farmers and ranchers are essential allies in generating climate solutions, but they need the right kind of financial support to do so. Funding from the National Clean Investment Fund will de-risk and catalyze replicable, scalable and equitable financial solutions that accelerate climate-smart agriculture implementation. The EPA’s announcement is a major step forward and will generate benefits for farms, ranches and rural communities across the nation.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Chris Espinosa, Legislative Director for Climate and Energy, Earthjustice:,“We applaud the Biden Administration for today’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards and especially commend them for ensuring that 70 percent of this funding will benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities. As we quickly transition to a clean energy economy, we cannot leave large parts of the country behind. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is a critical piece of the IRA to invest directly in low-income and disadvantaged communities that have long faced the disproportionate burden of pollution, energy development, and the worst impacts of climate change. These investments, plus the major private capital investments they will leverage, will spur sustainable development and job growth, lower energy costs for families, and empower communities with the funding they need to fight climate change and clean up their air, water, and land. While celebrating these funds, we look forward to upcoming awards under the Fund’s $7 billion Solar for All program, which dedicates 100 percent of its funding to low-income and disadvantaged communities.”,[,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Sylvia Chi, Senior Policy Analyst, Just Solutions, Founder, GGRF Equity and Governance Best Practices Alliance,: “We congratulate EPA on reaching such a historic milestone for this critical financing program which targets almost 70% of funds to low-income and disadvantaged communities, We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the GGRF awardees to ensure this program delivers significant and tangible benefits to the communities across our country that bear a disproportionate burden from pollution and climate change.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Irene Burga, Climate Justice and Clean Air Director, GreenLatinos,: “Growing up in a predominantly Latine and highly polluted part of Los Angeles County, I’ve witnessed first-hand the dire impact of pollution on the health, safety and ability to prosper in Latine communities. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund provides a lifeline, offering a chance for a cleaner, healthier future where every Latine family can access clean air and sustainable energy. For too long, our communities have suffered from pollution and environmental disparities, hindering our dreams and well-being. This fund provides the crucial financial support needed to deploy clean energy and pollution reduction projects, offering cleaner air, safer neighborhoods, and economic opportunities. Facing potential cuts, we must unite to defend this program, ensuring our community thrives in a pollution-free world, now and for future generations.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Steve Clemmer, Director of Energy Research and Analysis, Union of Concerned Scientists:,“Establishing the National Clean Investment Fund is pivotal in catalyzing the transition to an equitable, decarbonized economy. Using seed money from public funding to unlock additional private sector investment and new low-cost financing is a cornerstone in the transition to clean energy, and this program ensures the associated benefits are accessible to all. It is hopeful to see a list of non-profits that have a proven track record of financing clean energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Carrie Clark, Executive Director, North Carolina League of Conservation Voters:,“We thank Vice President Kamala Harris for coming to North Carolina and announcing the launch of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund; and it couldn’t come at a better time. According to the latest US climate assessment, North Carolina is one of the top five states facing the most expensive climate disasters. But North Carolina has also ranked first in the nation for business two years in a row, and first in the nation in rural clean energy jobs. If we want this success to continue, we must address the climate crisis. This announcement addresses the heart of the climate crisis and will help ensure North Carolina continues to be a great place for families and businesses to thrive.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Sandy Bahr, Arizona Chapter Director, Sierra Club,: “Sierra Club is excited to see today’s announcement of the awardees for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which will help communities throughout the U.S. with investments to facilitate a more rapid transition to clean energy. These dollars will be focused on Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and other communities that have experienced the worst impacts of pollution. Scaling up clean energy via this program will help to reduce pollution and energy costs, while improving the health of everyone, especially those in these overburdened communities.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Shelbie Swartz, Executive Director, Institute for a Progressive Nevada:,“Today’s announcement is a watershed moment for climate and clean energy funding in this country. Communities nationwide – especially Black, Latinx and other communities that have for decades faced the brunt of pollution – are going to see an injection of federal investments that will help accelerate the necessary and crucial transition to clean energy. That transition will happen in their homes, their towns, their businesses – building on a track record of successful green and community-based lenders across the country. The federal funding will help scale projects that push us closer to a pollution-free future, reduce energy costs, and improve the health of all Americans. The GGRF is one way the Biden administration is meeting its commitment to the Justice40 principles, and we are excited to see these investments break ground later this year.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Elizabeth Del Buono, MD, President, Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action,: “Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action (MiCCA) celebrates the announcement of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It is a significant step towards prioritizing the health and well-being of communities across the nation. This key component of President Biden’s climate and clean energy plan provides important resources in our fight against climate change and its detrimental impacts on public health.,By directing funding towards projects aimed at reducing pollution and lowering energy costs for families, the GGRF is fostering a cleaner and healthier environment for all. Given the disproportionate health impacts of those living closest to fossil fuel pollution, it is appropriate that a significant portion of this funding be allocated to communities that have historically struggled to access capital for pollution-reducing projects, including communities of color, low-income, rural, Tribal, and energy transition communities.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Mikaela Curry, Regional Field Manager, Sierra Club:,“The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund offers an incredible opportunity to equip communities with the tools they need to reduce pollution and improve health through meaningful investments. I am excited for the potential of this fund to bring real dollars to real people, especially for communities that are too often overlooked and underfunded, and have been disproportionately burdened by pollution.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Deirdre Nieves, Director of Climate Solutions and Justice, West Michigan Environmental Action Council:,“Today’s announcement of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) awardees marks another significant step in the right direction for West Michigan and environmental justice communities nationwide. With $20 billion allocated to green finance programs, including the National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, the GGRF will empower individuals, nonprofits, small businesses, and lenders to drive impactful projects. From community-owned solar initiatives to electrification loans for small businesses and homes, these investments will reduce pollution, lower energy costs, and create quality jobs. Importantly, over two-thirds of GGRF funding will prioritize communities historically marginalized in accessing capital for pollution-reduction projects. This underscores the GGRF’s commitment to advancing environmental justice and catalyzing inclusive economic growth. As we celebrate this milestone, let us recognize it as another step in the right direction towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],James Neal, Senior Manager for Finance Initiatives, Efficiency Maine,: “The Efficiency Maine Green Bank is grateful for and excited about the opportunities that this generous National Clean Investment Fund grant will provide. These funds will enable the Efficiency Maine Green Bank to offer loans for heat pump projects that will reduce Maine’s dependence on imported fuels and lower heating bills in homes and businesses across the state.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],PennFuture:,“PennFuture is excited to see the progress made today in the Biden Administration’s climate and clean energy plan with the awardees of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This financing program will help Pennsylvania communities overburdened by legacy industrial pollution to recover by implementing clean energy projects in their areas and reduce pollution. GGRF will create job opportunities in the clean energy sector while also providing Pennsylvanians with investments in home and business upgrades to lower their energy costs. We are grateful that more than two-thirds of all GGRF funding will be allocated to projects in communities that frequently face difficulty in accessing capital for projects that reduce pollution and decrease household energy expenses. These communities include people of color, low-income, disadvantaged, rural, Tribal, and energy transition communities.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Sunrise Movement:,“A huge announcement today: the EPA is launching a first-of-its-kind Green Investment Bank.

 Pritzker: “,A big day for Illinois and the entire nation. With @EPA’s investment in the @CGreenCapital, we have the opportunity of a lifetime to boost our Climate and Equitable Jobs Act goals. We’re on track to a clean energy future and economy that every Illinoisan can access.” [,X Post,, 04/04/2024],Senator Chuck Schumer (NY):,“The investments Democrats made are paying off for the American people. By providing $20 billion that will flow to tens of thousands of green and climate friendly projects across the country, today’s historic announcement, made possible by our Inflation Reduction Act, is ushering in the clean energy revolution. I am especially proud that EPA has secured commitments from today’s awardees that over 70 percent of the capital – over $14 billion – will go to low-income and disadvantaged communities. These investments mean cleaner communities, lower energy costs, and jobs, jobs, jobs. I’m proud of this bold investment in communities across America and New York and confident today’s announcement will have positive reverberations for generations to come.,For decades – low-income and disadvantaged communities have been disproportionally affected by climate change and environmental disasters. Now, we are pairing public dollars with private investment – mobilizing almost $7 of private capital for every $1 of federal funding with these populations in mind – to create good-paying union jobs, rid communities of pollution, and lower the cost of energy. Americans are already feeling the effects of the transformative Inflation Reduction Act, and today’s announcement of the initial funding for two of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund’s programs – the National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator – will only accelerate our country’s transition to a climate friendly and more equitable future.,Delivering on environmental justice was one of my north stars while writing the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is poised to be one of the most significant vehicles for delivering lasting support to our environmental justice communities. When you invest in renewable energy and clean buildings, you are investing in the technologies of the future and a better world for our children and grandchildren. I am proud to have led this historic program to passage in the Inflation Reduction Act to lower costs for families and creating good paying jobs securing America’s energy independent future.” [Statement, 04/04/2024],Senator Richard Blumenthal (CT),: ““This $5 billion in federal funding is critical to building clean energy infrastructure and a more energy resilient Connecticut. The Connecticut Green Bank is doing transformative work in our state to fight climate change and protect our most disadvantaged communities from environmental injustice. I am proud to fight alongside the Connecticut delegation for strong investments like these that will tackle the climate crisis, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and grow well-paying jobs.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Senator Chris Murphy (CT):,“Our state has set the national standard for green banks, and I’m thrilled to see this massive investment in the Connecticut Green Bank. This federal funding will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create good-paying jobs, and increase resilience in communities that have been the most impacted by climate change but have the fewest resources. It’s a win-win for the climate and our state’s economy.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Senator Tom Carper (DE):,“Every American should benefit from the investments we make to fight climate change, no matter their zip code. That’s why we created the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — to leverage both public and private investments to help finance a historic network of climate and clean energy projects, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Historically, those are the places least able to attract private capital, and we need to change that. These investments will lower energy costs for everyone and create good-paying jobs, and I applaud the EPA for moving quickly to implement this program. Congratulations to the eight recipients who will bring us one step closer to a clean energy future.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Senator Ed Markey (MA):,“After more than a decade of hard work, our vision to create a national climate bank is a reality. Thanks to the $20 billion we secured in the Inflation Reduction Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will draw on the experience of public, semi-public, and non-profit community leaders to unleash tens of billions of dollars to deliver more than money, but also justice, to disadvantaged communities in Massachusetts and across the country.,As the single largest climate investment in the Inflation Reduction Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will cut emissions, protect health, and create job and economic opportunities so that communities won’t just survive, but thrive, for generations to come. Even more than money, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is delivering hope – hope for justice and for a livable future. I applaud the Environmental Protection Agency’s work to quickly stand up this critical program while ensuring transparency and collaboration.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Representative Frank Pallone (NJ-06): “,This fund, created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, is critical to ensuring that nobody is left behind as we transition to clean energy. For years, underserved communities that have tried to invest in clean energy have repeatedly run into obstacles accessing the necessary capital. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is designed to fix that problem by building sustainable community lending capacity so everyone can benefit from clean energy.,The Inflation Reduction Act included $27 billion for EPA to build the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. EPA is still implementing the fund and working through the award selection process for each of the three funding opportunities announced last year.,This program is a game-changer. Third-party estimates project that investments made through the fund could save Americans more than $100 billion and create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs over the next decade—particularly in low-income and disadvantaged communities. This is what investing in America looks like. Good paying jobs today for a cleaner and healthier tomorrow. This is exactly the kind of thing this Committee should be getting behind. But not one Republican supported the Inflation Reduction Act, and now, true to form, they are already attacking it.,Their attacks are unwarranted. EPA has already put in important safeguards to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent properly. Each funding opportunity from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund includes mandatory reporting requirements that apply to any award or subaward, so that EPA can assess award performance and the progress on meeting key milestones. EPA also included annual audits that allow it to monitor how recipients are using their awards in order to make certain that funds are being spent appropriately. EPA also has the flexibility to make final awards contingent upon recipients taking additional steps that mitigate award-specific risks identified in the selection process.,These are strong oversight requirements that EPA has put into place to help ensure that every dollar goes toward accomplishing the fund’s goals. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is critical to our efforts to meet the environmental and economic challenges we face today. The worsening climate crisis continues to wreak havoc across the nation, costing families their homes, their livelihoods, and their lives. Wildfires and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change are ravaging our communities. Just last year, Americans experienced more billion-dollar disasters than any other year on record and natural disasters linked to climate change cost Americans more than $92 billion. By drastically cutting our emissions, we can aggressively combat the climate crisis, protect our communities, grow our economy through the clean energy transition, and save money in the long-term.,I am always disappointed when Republicans say they care about oversight but then make it clear at hearings that their only intention is to tear down programs that they oppose. They don’t want the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to work because they don’t want anything to undermine their agenda of putting polluters over people.,The size and scope of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is very large, but so is the challenge of combating climate change. Constructive congressional oversight can enhance EPA’s efforts to mitigate program risks and make certain that every dollar has the greatest possible impact. For the future of our nation and our world, we should be doing everything we can to ensure that this program succeeds. I look forward to hearing from the witness today on how we can best accomplish that.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Representative Chellie Pingree (ME-01),: “Green banks have proven to be instrumental in our transition to a clean energy economy, supporting renewable energy technology investments and deployment across the country. These are the kind of targeted tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we envisioned for our communities when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant piece of climate legislation in our nation’s history. This considerable investment for the Efficiency Maine Green Bank will not only help Mainers save on their home energy costs but will help propel our communities towards a more sustainable future.”,[,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Representative Debbie Dingell (MI-06):,“These awards are making clean energy financing accessible to low-income and underserved communities that have for far too long carried the brunt of environmental pollution, helping us attack the climate crisis head on and creating jobs while lowering energy costs. These investments will fund projects that otherwise would not have been possible, and will mobilize nearly seven times as much in private capital.

This funding will build on their important mission to invest in innovative green energy solutions, protect residents from dangerous pollution, and uplift communities that have been disproportionately impacted by environmental injustices.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Representative Joe Courtney (CT-02),: “When we talk about becoming more energy efficient, more energy independent, and better stewards of our environment, this is the kind of serious investment we need to achieve those goals. With the federal funding announced today from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Connecticut Green Bank will enable communities across the region to stand up more climate resilient infrastructure and projects that reduce greenhouse emissions.” [,Statement,, 04/04/2024],Representative Rosa DeLauro (CT-03):,“This award to the Connecticut Green Bank, the nation’s first green bank, will accelerate investments in the clean economy, reduce emissions and improve the quality of life for all Americans. The intent of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was to ensure that entities like the Connecticut Green Bank can spread the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act to underserved communities.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,11:47 A.M. EDT,MODERATOR:  Hey, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  Kirby has a few words here at the top, and then we’ll get started.,MR. KIRBY:  Hey, everybody.  Can you hear me okay?  I’m going to hope you can hear me okay.,Look, I just wanted to reiterate some things that we’ve been saying here in the last 24 hours.  We obviously welcome the steps that were announced last night and, again, overnight by the Israeli government at the President’s request in that call with Prime Minster Netanyahu.,And these steps, as you’ve all seen, they do include a commitment to open up additional crossings into Gaza, including the Ashdod port and the Erez Crossing, and also commitments to increase the amount of aid that’s getting into Gaza.  That’s important, particularly those coming from Jordan as well.,And as we’ve also said, it’s important for those commitments to be fully realized and to be rapidly implemented. We’re obviously standing by and prepared to work in full coordination with Israel and other governments in the region, including humanitarian aid organizations, to see that these steps are implemented in a sustained way and that they do result in a significant increase in humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.,So, again, we welcome these steps.  A lot of work is ahead.  And we’re prepared to continue to work, as we have, to see that these things are put in place in a sustainable way.,We also — you probably heard the Secretary of State talk about this earlier — we’re also reviewing Israel’s report of the investigation that they conducted into the World Central Kitchen team strike from a few days ago.  We’re going to take our time.  We’re going to review it carefully.  We’ll certainly be discussing the conclusions of it and our conclusions of it with Israeli officials and humanitarian aid organizations in coming days.,We note that they have held accountable a couple of officers and that they have made their findings public.  That’s important.  But again, what really matters here for us is sort of — is two things: one, that something like this does not happen again; and two, that there are concrete, verifiable, achievable, and again, sustainable changes to their processes in the way they conduct these kinds of missions so that the safety of civilians on the ground and humanitarian aid workers is top of mind and ensured.,With that, I’m happy to take some questions.,MODERATOR:  Thank you. Our first question will go to Steve Holland with Reuters.,Q    Hey, John.  Thanks for that.  There’s a video of the attack being shown in Israel.  Has this been seen here at the White House?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know, Steve.  I’m not aware of that video.  And I don’t know the degree to which it’s been seen here at the White House.,Q    And the changes that Israel is — like the opening of the ports, the punishment for the two officers, is that all there is?  Or have you asked them for — did the President ask them for specific things in addition to opening up these corridors for aid?  Or are they — are you just kind of waiting to get a sense of the entire changes that they make and render a judgment on them?,MR. KIRBY:  As I said, Steve, I mean, we welcome these initial announcements of additional crossings and increased aid. We welcome the release of their investigation.  As I said, we’re still going through it, so I don’t want to get ahead of our own look at this thing.  We certainly note that they did hold a couple of officers accountable.  They said they were going to include accountability.  They have done that.  Now, whether there’ll be more as they go through this, I don’t know and I’d have to refer you to the Israeli Defense Forces to speak to that going forward.,What’s important to us — I don’t want you to get too hung up on the homework assignment that we’ve given ourselves to look at their investigation.  What’s really important to us, and Secretary Blinken said this this morning, is that these changes are verifiable and they’re sustainable and that proper steps are taken to make sure that something like the strike that happened to the World Central Kitchen a few days ago can’t happen again.,And so we’re going to be looking, in terms of strike procedures, to make sure that they’re doing everything they can to prevent another one — another mistake like that — but also, on the aid and assistance, that it also is — the changes that they are announcing, the commitments that they are making, that they hold to them and that those changes too, in terms of increased aid, are sustainable.,The third thing that we didn’t talk about yet, which is — is the negotiations going on in Cairo this coming weekend, and one of the messages that the President had for Prime Minister Netanyahu was, you know, let’s get this done, let’s get a deal in place so that we can get a ceasefire for a matter of weeks in place so that it’s easier to meet those commitments on humanitarian assistance being increased — a whole lot easier to meet those commitments you made if there is a ceasefire in place and just as critically getting the hostages home.,Q    And Burns — is Burns in Cairo for these talks?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t ever talk about the travel habits of the CIA director.  I can just tell you that the United States will be present for those talks.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Aamer with the AP.,Q    Hey there.  So, just slight variation on Steve.  Is there specific things that the President would like the Israeli government to do, in addition to what’s being done, to sort of reach these overarching goals that you speak of to make sure that this doesn’t happen again?  Is there anything more that can be done?,And then secondly, just quickly, I believe Secretary Blinken also called for an “independent, thorough, and fully publicized investigation” of the tragedy.  Who does the White House believe could be a credible authority to carry out this investigation?,MR. KIRBY:  Look, I think on the independent investigation thing — and we’ve seen Chef Andrés has called for that — we’re going to reserve — as I said yesterday, we’re going to reserve judgment on that until we’ve had a chance to see and carefully review the results of the investigation, the independent investigation that they themselves conducted.  So I’m just going to leave that there.,And as for the “more to do” — again, Aamer, I think we’ve been very open with all of you about the call yesterday and the asks that the President made.  And some of those asks were initially realized here in these announcements that the Israelis have made.,But let me just summarize — without getting into too much detail, let me just summarize them in general, and I kind of covered this with Steve.  It’s putting in place procedures and fixes so that an attack like this and a mistake like this can’t happen again.  It’s doing more to look after the safety of civilians on the ground, including aid workers, and giving them confidence — confidence-building measures so that aid organizations can continue to operate inside Gaza and feel that they can do so safely.  It’s increasing the humanitarian assistance getting in.  That means, A, opening up more crossings, and we’ve seen some announcements that have been positive over the last few hours; and B, increasing the number of trucks that get in to up over 300, and that includes increasing that flow from Jordan.,And again, those initial steps have been announced, and we welcome that.,And then the third big chunk here is about getting back at the table in negotiations in Cairo and getting a hostage deal done and powering his negotiators to come to a conclusion on this so that we can get the hostages home with their families where they belong.  We are coming up on six months — six months that these people have been held hostage in what we have to consider are just abhorrent conditions.  They need to be home with their families.  That also gives us a ceasefire of a matter of about six weeks, which, again, as I said earlier, would make it much easier for humanitarian assistance to flow.,So those are the three big buckets, and I think I’ll leave it at that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Andrea Mitchell with NBC.,Q    Hi.  Thank you very much for taking the question.  I’m about to go on the air, so a quick question about the hostages.  Did the President press Prime Minister Netanyahu to try to get to yes on the hostage issues and be less specific about the demand on proportionality?  Can you get into any of the details on that?,And there does seem to be a conflict between what Secretary Blinken said and what you just said about the independent investigation.  If you could try to clarify that or take that question.  Thank you so much.,MR. KIRBY:  I did not see Secretary Blinken make a call for an independent investigation.  He said that we were — what I looked at, he said they’re reviewing — we’re reviewing Israel’s investigation carefully and that we’re going to be discussing it with the conclusions of Israeli officials and humanitarian aid organizations.  So, I have not seen that.,And as I said, we’re going to reserve judgment on whether there needs to be another investigation based on the conclusions we come up to, looking at the one that they conducted.,And on your first question, Andrea, the short answer is: Yes, he did urge Prime Minister Netanyahu to get to yes on negotiating — on a deal to get the hostages out and on these negotiations.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Weijia with CBS.,Q    Thank you.  And thank you, John, for taking the question.  Just to follow up on Andrea and Aamer, he did say that.  He said, “It’s also critical that we see an independent, thorough, [and] fully publicized investigation into the killing of the World Central Kitchen team…”  So if you don’t have an explanation for the discrepancy now, will you please get back to us?,MR. KIRBY:  He might have been referring — look, I’m going to refer you to the State Department.  I wasn’t with the Secretary when he made those comments, so I think you guys are asking me to comment on comments that I don’t have visibility on.,I would just note a couple of things.  The investigation that they concluded was an independent investigation.  It was done by an agency of the Israeli government that does not report directly to the IDF chain of command.  It’s sort of akin to our own inspector general reports that you guys are very familiar with.  It’s not a perfect analogy, but it’s close to that.  That was an independent investigation.,And we are now going through that ourselves.  And as far as a third independent investigation — in other words, something outside the Israeli government, which is what I know Chef Andrés has called for — we’re going to reserve our judgment based on our conclusions on this independent investigation.,Q    And then, on the timing of the reports released, was that a coincidence, or did the President push for it to be made public during the phone call yesterday?,MR. KIRBY:  We made it clear, even before the call with Prime Minister Netanyahu, that we expected — and we said so publicly — that they would conduct a thorough, complete investigation and that they would make it public, that they would be transparent about it.,Q    Did they talk about the report’s findings during the phone call?,MR. KIRBY:  Not in any specific terms.  Prime Minister Netanyahu had only just received it himself.  So he covered sort of a broad brush at the top of the conversation, sort of the general findings, but he didn’t go into great detail.,Q    Okay.  And then, finally, I know you were asked about the video earlier, but aside from that, has the administration reviewed any evidence, or have you requested to see any evidence that backs up the findings?,MR. KIRBY:  We are working our way through the investigation right now.  I’ll just leave it at that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Selina with ABC.,Q    Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Admiral.  So just to clarify what everyone has been asking, you’re not ruling out, from the White House perspective, that the U.S. could do an independent investigation?  Is that — just to clarify.,MR. KIRBY:  There are no plans for us to conduct — (audio feedback) — is that okay?  Can you hear me?,Q    Sorry, yes, I can hear you.,MR. KIRBY:  There are no plans for the U.S. to conduct an independent investigation or a separate investigation into this event.  Guys, they just finished it, and we are just now getting a chance to look at it.,I think it’s important to let us have the time, as Secretary Blinken said, to do this in a careful, thoughtful way.  And then we’ll reserve judgment about it once we’ve had a chance to go through it.,It seems like there’s — well, I’ll just leave it at that.  We’re going to — we’re going do this right.  We’re going to take our time with it.  We’re going to continue to consult with the Israeli officials as we look at the investigation.,We have seen and we’re aware of people and institutions, including Chef Andrés, who want something separate than what the Israelis have done.  We’re reserving judgment on that until we’ve had a chance to review this carefully.,Q    And you said the calls are for civilians and aid workers, for Israel to do more to protect them inside Gaza.  They’ve agreed to open a few more crossings.  Can you give any other specific examples of what this administration is looking for?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m not going to go into more detail than what we’ve already done on that.,And let me come back to the confusion about independent and what Secretary Blinken said.  Because I’ve been — while we’ve been talking, I’ve asked the team here to check with State.  And what I’m hearing from State is that Secretary Blinken did refer to an independent investigation, but that was before — he was referring to the one that they were working on.  And he said that before Israel came out with the report that we are now examining.,Q    And just one more question.  Any update on that meeting next week with the Israeli delegation in person on Rafah?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have any updates for you.  We’re hoping to get it done in the next week or two.  It’s possible that that meeting could slide to the week after next.  We just don’t have anything firm.  But obviously — look, guys, as soon as we get something nailed down on the calendar, you know we’re going to tell you about it.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Jordan with Bloomberg.,Q    Thanks, Admiral.  We have a report saying that some key Israeli policymakers have started to push back on the idea of a full-scale invasion of Rafah.  One suggested that Israel could simply surround the four remaining Hamas battalions in that area.  Is this an idea that the U.S. would support?  And was this idea of surrounding the battalions, rather than a full- scale investigation, discussed between the two leaders, or was it discussed between administration officials and the Israeli Defense Minister when he was in town earlier this week?,MR. KIRBY:  Look, we haven’t even completed the conversations with the Israelis here about Rafah.  We’re looking forward, as I just answered to Selina, in having that conversation here in coming days.  And I think you can understand we’re going to reserve our thoughts about alternatives to a ground offensive in Rafah to our private conversations with our Israeli counterparts.,As I said yesterday from the podium, the Rafah operation was not a focus of the discussion between the President and the Prime Minister.  That was really focused more on the aftermath of the strike and the implications that that strike has had on humanitarian aid organizations and their willingness to continue to operate inside Gaza and the kinds of things that we needed Israel to do.  We’ve detailed those for you as far as I’m going to detail them for you.  But that was really the — that was really the focus.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Gordon with the Wall Street Journal.,Q    Hey, John.  Thanks, Sam.  Two, kind of, clarifications, and I may have missed it from yesterday, but did the President and Netanyahu talk about the strikes in Syria?  And did the President have a message to convey when it comes to widening the conflict, or whatever, there?,And then, second thing is: You know, you mentioned that you expect — you mentioned yesterday that you expected a series of announcements from the Israelis.  I assume one of those is the results of the investigation on the WCK attack and then another one was maybe about the other gate opening.  But do you have others, do you expect, that are in train, potentially over the next day or so, on other matters?  Or no?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m sorry, Gordon, I missed your first question.  Can you —,Q    The first question was: Did the President and Netanyahu talk about the Israeli strikes in Damascus?  And did the President convey any concerns about widening the conflict?,MR. KIRBY:  Oh, okay.  So, on your first question, there wasn’t a specific focus on what happened in Damascus.  As I’ve said before, we had no role in that whatsoever.  That said, there was discussion between the two leaders about the very viable and, quite frankly, very public threat that Iran is making to Israel’s security in the last day or so.  And the President made very, very clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that he can count on U.S. support to help them in their self-defense against threats directly and publicly posed by Iran.  So, that’s that.,On the more announcements, I mean, as I said yesterday, we were expecting some announcements in coming hours and days.  We’ve started to see some of those announcements.  I’ll refer to the Israelis to speak to whether they’ve got more coming and what they might be.,What we’re focused on, Gordon, is not the announcements.  The announcements are welcomed, and they certainly did come in the wake of the President’s direct requests.  But what we’re really looking for now is a sustainable commitment to meet those — what’s been announced; to make real, lasting, permanent changes to the way they’re doing business inside Gaza, both operationally and from a humanitarian perspective.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Missy Ryan with the Washington Post.,Q    Hey, John.  Just two questions.  Was there — and apologies if I missed this — did you have an update on the planned travel by Jake to Saudi Arabia?  Yesterday, you talked about — or the other day you talked about him postponing that because of his health situation.,And then, just stepping back to the U.S. analysis of the steps that the Israelis are taking and their investigation and then the readout of the Bibi call, should we be reading anything specifically into the fact that what you and the President and Secretary Blinken have said is that, you know, if the Israelis don’t show sort of effective changes, that it’ll affect U.S. policy on Gaza versus U.S. policy on Israel?,I wondered whether this was trying to signal that some sort of support or the stance towards that particular operation might change.  But as you guys are saying, that the overall relationship isn’t going to change, are you trying to sort of caveat what the implications would be if they fail to meet the threshold that you guys are laying out?  Thanks.,MR. KIRBY:  I think you’re ascribing to us perhaps more parsing of language than we deserve.,But let me take the first question first.  And I don’t have an update on Jake’s trip to the Middle East and to Saudi.  I know that he very much wants to get it back on the schedule, and the team is working hard to see what we can do to do that.  But, you know, his health obviously has to come first.,And then, on your second question, we’re talking about, as we have all said consistently, that we need to see changes in their policy towards the fighting in Gaza and the support to humanitarian aid organizations, or we will have to make changes to our policy with respect to supporting their efforts in Gaza.  And I think it’s best if I just leave it at that.,The only thing I’d add is — and I kind of got to this in an earlier question — they live in a tough neighborhood.  And while we are all rightly concerned about what’s going on in Gaza operationally and from a humanitarian perspective, we can’t forget that they are under a range of other threats not related to the war in Gaza, from Hezbollah in the north; even the Houthis down in Yemen are launching missiles at them.  And of course, there’s the militia groups that Iran supports in Iraq and Syria and the very public, direct nation-state threats that Iran has made to Israel’s security.,The Israeli people do not need to be reminded of the threat that they’re living under.  And the President made clear in that call yesterday, particularly given these public threats by Iran, that Israel will continue, as they have had for so many years in the past and through so many different administrations, the American support for their self-defense.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Andrew with The Independent,Q    Hi, can you all hear me okay?,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I got you, buddy.,Q    Wonderful.  Thanks for taking my question.  John, I know you have said multiple times on this call that you want to get through the report and review of the Israeli report.  But there have been over 200 aid workers killed during this conflict.  And I’m wondering why, given what has become — I don’t want to call it a habit, but the number of aid workers killed by the IDF and the fact the IDF has shot some of their own people on occasion and seems to have exonerated anyone from wrongdoing there, why this Israeli report — prepared very, very quickly and I don’t want to say under duress, but with the possible objective of avoiding any consequences from the Biden administration — why should it be given a presumption of good faith?,And I understand you spoke to your counterparts at State, but why shouldn’t Secretary Blinken’s original call for an independent investigation not be followed through on?,MR. KIRBY:  Again, I don’t want to put words in Secretary Blinken’s mouth.  I would refer you to my colleagues there.  But we’ve been communicating with them during this gaggle so that I can make sure I had the context.  He called for that independent investigation while they were working on their independent investigation.  And that was the investigation he was referring to.  Because he understands, like I understand, that they have a process inside their government to conduct independent investigations, again, not unlike the ones that we conduct using inspectors general.  It’s not a perfect analogy, but it’s as close as I can get to it.  That’s what he was calling for.,As for separate calls, I’m happy to repeat my answer.  As for separate calls for something additionally and independent outside of Israel, which we’ve seen certainly Chef Andrés call for, we’re just reserving judgment until we’ve had a chance to go through what they just produced.  I mean, my goodness, guys, they just gave it to us.  So we’re going to take the time — we’re going to take time, we’re going to look at it, and then we’ll reserve judgment based on what we find and what we see and what questions we might have for our Israeli counterparts.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Patsy with VOA.,Q    Thanks, Sam.  I’m going to try again, John.  The IDF said that the officers misidentified the three World Central Kitchen vehicles and they believed that Hamas gunmen was hiding in the convoy.  I’m going to try again and see if you can give an early assessment of whether this explanation makes sense considering what we’ve heard from Chef Andrés.,MR. KIRBY:  No, I’m not going to do that at this time.,Q    Okay, and so another question.  You said that the strike — the World Central Kitchen strike — was the reason for the President’s call to Prime Minister Netanyahu.  I’m also tracking that the President met Monday with three doctors who have been in Gaza and also with Senator Sanders on Wednesday.  Obviously, he is a critic of the war.  Did the two meetings in any way also shape the President’s decision to say what he said to Prime Minister Netanyahu?  Can you assure that?,MR. KIRBY:  The President’s discussion yesterday with the Prime Minister — certainly the impetus for the call was in the wake of this; it was this strike on the WCK workers.  As I said yesterday, that was certainly the catalyst for this phone call.,But I think it’s important to remember in context that the President’s concern and frustration has been growing over weeks and months based on things he’s been seeing coming out of Gaza — you know, civilians still being killed, infrastructure still being destroyed, not enough trucks getting in, the need to supplement the lack of trucks getting in by conducting airdrops.  I mean, you have to put everything into context.  I mean, all of that has been weighing on the President’s mind as he was thinking this through, and that includes conversations, yes, that he’s been having with people who have their own views and their own experiences.,Q    Okay.  And thank you.  And one last one, John.  How would you respond to criticism that the death of one American was able to move the President in a way that the death of 33,000 Palestinians did not?,MR. KIRBY:  I think that I just answered that question.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nathan with KAN.,Q    Thanks so much.  A couple of questions.  First of all, regarding the investigation, is the U.S. looking also into the question whether American-made weapons or ammunitions were involved in this attack?  Does the report give an answer to that?  And if there were American weapons, would that make any difference?,MR. KIRBY:  You’d have to talk to the Israelis about the details of the report.  As I said, we’re going through that.  I’m not going to speak for an Israeli investigation that they’ve conducted and they’ve submitted.  We’re looking at it, we’re reviewing it, and I believe the Pentagon has been asked this question about American-made weapons, and there’s — they have said that they’re not in a position to verify the use of any particular weapon in any particular Israeli operation.  Those are questions that are much better put to the Israeli Defense Force.,Q    Thanks.  One more thing about putting in place new procedures that would ensure the safety of aid workers and of civilians.  Would there be an American mechanism that would follow up on this?  Would there be U.S. representatives on the ground, in the control rooms?  How would you make sure that Israel is following up on this?,MR. KIRBY:  No, there’s no intent to put American servicemen and women, or military experts, civilians — however you want to put it — there’s no intention to put Americans in the decision-making loop here on Israeli operations.  They’re a sovereign country.  They conduct their own military operations.  How they conduct those operations is obviously of interest to us, and that’s the context of the conversation that the two leaders had yesterday.  But, no, there’s not going to be an effort to do that.,What we are interested in, as I’ve alluded to earlier, is sustainable, implementable, deconfliction processes, particularly when it comes to humanitarian aid organizations, so that there is a sufficient linkage, muscle and sinew, between aid organizations and the IDF in terms of real-time information-sharing and knowledge of what each other is doing so that this doesn’t happen again.  And that’s what we’re going to be looking for — real, practical changes to their deconfliction system.,Q    Thanks.  And just one more quick question.  Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid is scheduled to be in Washington next week.  Will he be meeting with an administration official?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything to speak to on the calendar, but if that changes, we’ll certainly make that evident to you.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Yuna with Israel Channel 12.,Q    Hi.  Thank you for this.  So, (inaudible) approved and declared satisfying the White House and the President.  You have spoken about this in general, but this is something that the U.S. said that, regards to that, the U.S. will decide the policy.  And also, did the President threaten with conditioning aid during the call with Prime Minister Netanyahu?,MR. KIRBY:  I’ve answered this one before.  What we’ve said is — and it’s right in the readout — our policy with respect to Gaza will be greatly impacted by our assessments of Israeli follow-through on the commitments that they’ve made, both in terms of deconfliction and confidence-building measures for humanitarian aid organizations, as well as the increase of aid getting in, reduction of civilian casualties, and of course, an effort to move forward on a deal to get the hostages out and a ceasefire in place for a period of weeks.,So our Gaza policy will be affected greatly by our assessment of how the Israelis meet these commitments over time, in a sustainable way.,And as for conditioning aid, I am simply not going to go into greater detail about the conversation between the two leaders.  The President reiterated that we need to see meaningful progress and changes in Israeli policy and operational decision-making.  And I’ll leave it at that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nadia.,Q    Thank you, Sam.  Hi, John.  The President seems to be pushing Netanyahu to conclude this hostage deal.  I’m just wondering why the President didn’t push him or give him an ultimatum a month ago when the same deal was on the table, and Netanyahu rejected it.  And you could have saved both Palestinians and hostages’ lives, because (inaudible) reported today one hostage was killed by Israeli gunfire.,And second, will you ask for an investigation of how the IDF is using AI program that targeting thousands of civilians, apparently?  And I asked you about this yesterday; you said you would get back to me, but this is another chance.  Maybe you have some more information about this.  Thank you.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I wish I did there.  I don’t.  We’re still looking at that — that report.,On your first question, we’ve been working diligently, very, very hard, for months now to get all those hostages out.  There is no lack of a sense of urgency by the President to do that, both in our conversations with our Israeli counterparts but also, of course, with our conversations with our Qatari counterparts who have the communication linkage with Hamas.,So the idea that we are somehow sitting on our hands — and I’m not saying you said that — but the notion that we’re not pursuing this with great energy and effort just doesn’t comport with the facts.,But, yes, it was a conversation topic yesterday that the President, again, urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to fully empower his negotiators in Cairo so that we can get this deal done as soon as possible.,We believe — we are mindful that with each passing day, those hostages are at greater and greater risk and that their health is, without question, suffering all the more.  We want them home.  We’ve wanted them home since the 7th of October.  We’re not going to stop working on that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Francesca with USA Today.,Q    Thanks, Kirby.  And I know that you’ve touched on this at various points, but could you just bring us into the President’s thinking a little bit more broadly on this issue?  What is his reticence in conditioning the military aid?  Why hasn’t he felt that it was necessary at this point?  And just, what about this specific stri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e on the aid workers this week has him rethinking U.S. policy?,MR. KIRBY:  I just don’t have anything more to add on the questions about conditioning aid.  I can’t — I simply have nothing more to say about that.,And as I said earlier to a previous question, he has been watching over recent weeks and months, you know, the increasing death toll of civilians, the lack of progress in terms of getting humanitarian assistance in over ground.  That’s one of the reasons why he ordered the military to start conducting airdrops, to try to supplement that.  It’s not sufficient, but it’s a supplement.,So I think what you’re seeing is a growing set of concerns now over weeks and months about the situation — the humanitarian situation, in particular in Gaza.,This strike on the World Central Kitchen, yes, it was horrific in its own right, of course, but you saw yourself, Francesca, that aid organizations in the wake of it started to make decisions, like the World Food Program.  You can’t ignore that development.  You can’t just — you can’t just close your eyes and ears to that when an organization like WFP says, “Well, that’s it.  You know, we’re going to pull back.”  I mean, they’re having a big impact inside Gaza, and we absolutely want to see that impact continue.,So, all of that led to the President’s decision to have this very direct, very frank conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu.,And I want to go back to, you know, kind of where we started.  We have seen some welcome announcements from the Israelis.  They have acted on the President’s request coming out of that call; you’re starting to see it for yourself.  Now, again, as I said, these are just announcements.  We got to see results.  We got to see sustainable deliverables here over time.  It’s not enough just to announce it.  But they have moved on some of the very specific requests that the President made.,Q    And do you know if he’s spoken to Senator Coons or if that had any sort of an influence on his decision-making process here, or potentially the critiques that former Obama administration officials have been making?,MR. KIRBY:  I can’t speak for the latter.  As you know, he does speak to Senator Coons quite a bit.  I don’t know if there was a specific conversation that he had with Senator Coons in recent days.  But they’re close, and they speak frequently.,But as I said to an earlier question, certainly his views have been informed by conversations he has been having with people with experience in Gaza and with members of Congress up on Capitol Hill, as well as his own national security team and other foreign leaders that he’s been speaking to.  I mean, there’s a mosaic here of context through which the President makes these kinds of decisions, and he’ll continue to do so.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Fraser with France 24.  Fraser, we can’t hear you.  We still can’t hear you.  So sorry.,And it looks like that’s all the time we’ll actually have today.  If we haven’t gotten to you, as always, feel free to reach out.  Thanks.,END    12:27 P.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington," DC 20500""",05-04-24,On-the-Record Press Gaggle by White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/04/05/on-the-record-press-gaggle-by-white-house-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-10/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Leuven, Belgium,I.,Introduction,The sixth ministerial meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (“TTC”) took place in Leuven, Belgium, on 4 and 5 April 2024. It was co-chaired by European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, United States Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai, joined by European Commissioner Thierry Breton, and hosted by the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.,The meeting took place against the backdrop of significant geopolitical developments and challenges, including Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, that have shaken the international rules-based order to which we are jointly committed. The United States and the European Union remain unwavering in our long-term political, financial, humanitarian, and military support to Ukraine.,There has been a buildup of global economic pressure through extensive non-market policies and practices. This accentuates excessive and possibly high-risk dependencies of strategic supplies, tilts the level playing field, and poses a threat to our economic security, our prosperity, and the well-being of our firms, workers, and citizens.,The acceleration of the digital transformation creates unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation but also raises numerous risks and challenges that call for accelerating our efforts to establish joint leadership and continue robust coordination on our approaches for creating rules of the road for emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum technologies, and 6G wireless communication systems. We aim to foster interoperability and support our common democratic values and the protection of human rights, while also promoting innovation. We are also dedicated to continuing to equip our workforce with the skills necessary to meet the needs created by rapidly changing technology, including AI.,The cooperation between the United States and the European Union continues to be the bedrock for dealing with such global challenges, and the TTC has played a vital role in shaping a forward-looking dialogue and facilitating unprecedented coordination and quick responses to key trade and technology related issues and developments, not least in the context of Russia’s continued aggression against Ukraine. We therefore reaffirm the importance of the TTC and will continue to refine and adapt this forum to advance our shared objectives.,We have used the TTC to address global trade challenges, strengthen our economic and trade ties, accelerate the transition to climate-neutral economies, and boost our economic security. With the Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade (TIST), the TTC is contributing to the creation of a stronger, more sustainable, and more resilient transatlantic marketplace and facilitating environmentally responsible trade in goods and technologies. We have increased cooperation on interoperability of digital trade tools as well as standardisation of critical and emerging technologies to reduce the costs of trading across the Atlantic. To boost our economic security, we continue to cooperate through the TTC to diversify strategic supply chains, including solar panels, semiconductors, and critical raw materials, and to reduce vulnerabilities, including those caused by other countries’ non-market policies and practices. We have also deepened our dialogue and cooperation on export controls and investment screening.,Working with stakeholders, we continue to use the TTC to advance the governance of critical and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, semiconductors, biotechnology, and online platforms, including by supporting the development of rights-respecting international technical standards, codes of conduct, principles, and guidance. In particular, we call upon online platforms to ensure their services contribute to an environment that protects, empowers, and respects their users and the general public. We are working together to advance public interest research on online platforms, including to address particular societal risks, such as technology-facilitated gender-based violence. We will continue to combat foreign information manipulation and interference and to protect human rights defenders online, including in the context of elections.,We intend to continue our trade and technology cooperation as set out below.,II.,Key Outcomes of the Sixth TTC Ministerial Meeting,A. Advancing Transatlantic Leadership on Critical and Emerging Technologies Artificial Intelligence,The United States and the European Union reaffirm our commitment to a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and to advancing safe, secure, and trustworthy AI technologies. The dedicated coordination under the TTC continues to be instrumental to implementing our respective policy approaches which aim to reap the potential benefits of AI while protecting individuals and, society against its potential risks, and upholding human rights.,Our exchanges confirm our joint understanding that transparency and risk mitigation are key elements to ensure the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI, and we will continue to coordinate our contributions to multilateral initiatives such as the G7, the OECD, G20, Council of Europe, and UN processes to advance the responsible stewardship of AI. We encourage advanced AI developers in the United States and Europe to further the application of the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems which complements our respective governance and regulatory systems.,With a view to ensuring continued and impactful cooperation on AI, leaders from the European AI Office and the U.S. AI Safety Institute have briefed one another on their respective approaches and mandates. These institutions today committed to establishing a Dialogue to deepen their collaboration, particularly to foster scientific information exchange among their respective scientific entities and affiliates on topics such as, benchmarks, potential risks, and future technological trends.,This cooperation will contribute to making progress with the implementation of the,Joint Roadmap on Evaluation and Measurement Tools for Trustworthy AI and Risk Management,, which is essential to minimize divergence as appropriate in our respective emerging AI governance and regulatory systems, and to cooperate on interoperable and international standards. Following stakeholder consultations, we have further developed a list of key AI terms with mutually accepted joint definitions and published an,updated version,.,We are also united in our belief of the potential of AI to address some of the world’s greatest challenges. We applaud the United Nations General Assembly Plenary Resolution “Seizing the Opportunities of Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Systems for Sustainable Development,” that has solidified a global consensus around the need to manage the risks of AI while harnessing its benefits for sustainable development and the protection and promotion of human rights.,We are advancing on the promise of AI for sustainable development in our bilateral relationship through joint research cooperation as part of the administrative arrangement on artificial intelligence and computing to address global challenges for the public good. Working groups jointly staffed by U.S. science agencies and European Commission departments and agencies have achieved substantial progress by defining,critical milestones for deliverables in the areas of extreme weather, energy, emergency response, and reconstruction,. We are also making constructive progress in health and agriculture.,We will continue to explore opportunities with our partners in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany in the AI for Development Donor Partnership to accelerate and align our foreign assistance in Africa to support educators, entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens to harness the promise of AI.,Quantum,The United States and the European Union established a Quantum Task Force to address open questions on science and technology cooperation between the United States and the European Union on quantum technologies. Its primary objective is to bridge gaps in research and development (R&D) between the United States and the European Union, thereby harmonizing efforts in quantum technology advancements. This includes the establishment of a shared understanding and approach to technology readiness levels, development of unified benchmarks, identification of critical components in quantum technology, and advancement of international standards.,The task force continues work to address key questions that are necessary to reach an agreement on launching joint actions for science and technology cooperation in quantum, such as reciprocity in openness of quantum research programs and in intellectual property rights regimes.,Post-Quantum Cryptography Coordination,The United States and the European Union affirm the importance of the rapid mobilization to secure our digital communication networks against the threats posed by the potential for a future cryptanalytically-relevant quantum computer. Our joint work in Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC), feeding into the U.S-EU Cyber Dialogue, enables U.S. and EU partners to share information to understand activities in PQC standardization and in the transition to PQC.,The Road to 6G,The United States and the European Union share the belief that advanced connectivity can  facilitate a more inclusive, sustainable, and secure global economy. We concur on shared principles for the research and development of 6G wireless communication systems, and we recognize that by working together we can support the development of technologies and global technical standards for tomorrow’s critical digital infrastructure that reflect shared principles and values. We support open, global, market-driven, and inclusive multi-stakeholder approaches for the development of technical standards for secure and interoperable telecommunications equipment and services. On the road to 6G, in a geopolitical environment increasingly marked by tension and conflict, the growing requirement for security and resilience of key enabling communications technologies and critical infrastructure highlights the need to rely on trusted suppliers, to prevent vulnerabilities and dependencies, with potential downstream effects on the entire industrial ecosystem.,We delivered a 6G outlook in May 2023. In addition, the two main industry associations on each side of the Atlantic jointly developed a,6G Industry Roadmap,in December 2023. The roadmap affirmed the commitment of the stakeholders to collaborate on the development of 6G networks and proposed a comprehensive set of critical strategic reflections and recommendations from academia and industry. On 26 February 2024, ten countries, including some EU Member States concluded a,joint statement on 6G,.,These milestones have contributed to shaping the joint “,6G vision,” that we are adopting today. This vision focuses on technology challenges and research collaboration including on microelectronics; AI and cloud solutions for 6G; security and resilience; affordability and inclusiveness, sustainability and energy efficiency; openness and interoperability; efficient radio spectrum usage; and the standardisation process.,Having decided on this 6G vision, the United States and the European Union will strengthen cooperation between their research and innovation funding agencies, notably through an Administrative Arrangement signed between the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Directorate‑General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) of the European Commission covering collaboration in the field of 6G and Next Generation Internet technologies.,Considering the importance of developing a common vision to 6G and cooperating in the global standardisation process through standardisation organisations such as ETSI/3GPP, we also intend to develop an outreach plan with likeminded partners to support and advance the development of 6G networks.,Semiconductors,The coordination on our respective efforts to build resilient semiconductor supply chains remains crucial to the secure supply of semiconductors, which are indispensable inputs to an ever-growing range of key industry sectors, and to ensure leadership in cutting-edge technologies.,We have been cooperating fruitfully under two administrative arrangements:,We intend to extend the two administrative arrangements for a period of three years to enable further coordination and to establish synergies between our support for investments in the semiconductor sector taking place under the EU Chips Act and the U.S. CHIPS Act.,The United States and the European Union share concerns about non-market economic policies and practices that may lead to distortionary effects or excessive dependencies for mature node (“legacy”) semiconductors. On the side of the fifth TTC ministerial meeting, which took place on 30 January 2024 in Washington, D.C., we held a joint roundtable with high-level industry representatives dedicated to legacy semiconductor supply chains. Both the United States and the European Union are committed to continuing to engage closely with industry on the issue. We plan to convene further government-to-government discussions with like-minded countries on this topic in the near future. In January 2024, the United States launched an industry survey to assess the use of legacy chips in supply chains that directly or indirectly support U.S. national security and critical infrastructure. The European Union is also gathering information on this issue. We intend to, as appropriate, continue to collect and share non-confidential information and market intelligence about non-market policies and practices, commit to consult each other on planned actions, and may develop joint or cooperative measures to address distortionary effects on the global supply chain for legacy semiconductors.,We plan to continue working to identify research cooperation opportunities on alternatives to the use of per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) in chips. For example, we plan to explore the use of AI capacities and digital twins to accelerate the discovery of suitable materials to replace PFAS in semiconductor manufacturing.,Biotechnology Cooperation to Promote the Bioeconomy and Address Global Challenges,The bioeconomy is supported by the use of foundational and widely-applicable tools and technologies (including emerging biotechnologies), which have the potential to drive innovation to address global challenges. .These tools and technologies also represent an opportunity to begin developing a common international understanding of the bioeconomy and future efforts to evaluate, measure, and grow the global bioeconomy as a whole. A crucial component of this effort is establishing a shared understanding of some of the risks and vulnerabilities associated with the bioeconomy, including economic and security considerations, alongside a simultaneous commitment to enabling the safe, secure, sustainable, and responsible use of tools and technologies for bioeconomic development.,We look forward to cooperating on shared research, development, and innovation priorities through the U.S.-EU Joint Consultative Group that will push bioeconomic development forward in ways that address the most pressing global challenges we all face.,We acknowledge the significant promise and risks associated with the integration of advanced biotechnology with other technological disciplines such as AI, information technology, nanotechnology, neurotechnology, chemistry, and medicine, which will drive innovation and have significant implications for academia, industry, and economic security. To address the potential risks associated with the convergence of these technologies, we are committed to work toward mechanisms to safeguard dual-use advanced biotechnology items and equipment.,Transatlantic Cooperation on Standards for Critical and Emerging Technologies and Clean Energy Transition,The United States and the European Union share an interest in recognizing mutually compatible technical standards as a way to expand transatlantic approaches for the deployment of critical and emerging technologies that reflect our shared values.,We plan to continue to exchange information on international standardisation activities for critical and emerging technologies via the “Strategic Standardisation Information (SSI)” mechanism, as established at the second U.S-EU TTC ministerial meeting. Our deepened cooperation enables us to cooperate on global standards. In order to strengthen collaboration with the private sector, we organised a,joint stakeholder workshop,in Washington D.C. on 17 November 2023, which identified relevant areas for transatlantic collaboration.,Together with standards development organisations and stakeholders, we have endeavoured to work towards mutually compatible standards and best practices in areas of strategic interest with the objective of avoiding unnecessarily burdensome technical trade barriers, without prejudice to the specificities and needs of our respective legal systems.,Over the last two years, our cooperation has led to tangible outcomes. We have facilitated commonly recognised international standards for the rollout of megawatt charging systems for heavy-duty vehicle charging points, and joint work of U.S. and EU standardisation bodies on plastics recycling and additive manufacturing since the start of the TTC. Our work continues to facilitate the development of mutually recognised and compatible standards to enhance new opportunities for cooperation within our respective standardisation systems.,Following a successful round of government-to-government technical exchanges, the European Commission and U.S. government released a Digital Identity Mapping Exercise Report,Digital Identity Mapping Exercise Report,which provides the results of an initial mapping centred on the definitions, assurance levels, and references to international standards included across Revision 3 of the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines (,Special Publication 800-63, Revision 3,) and European Regulation,(EU) No 910/2014,on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The next phase of this project will focus on identifying potential use cases for transatlantic interoperability and cooperation with a view toward enabling the cross-border use of digital identities and wallets.,The United States and the European Union intend to continue to identify emerging technology standards that are enablers of the clean energy transition for transatlantic collaboration.,B. Promoting Sustainability and New Opportunities for Trade and Investment,Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade,The Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade (TIST) work programme, which we launched at the fourth U.S-EU TTC ministerial meeting in May 2023, has advanced our cooperation on actions to accelerate the transition to climate-neutral economies in the United States and the European Union in a mutually beneficial way. The United States and the European Union have been making progress on the different work strands under the TIST work programme and will continue to advance this work.,Building a Transatlantic Green Marketplace,Building on our strong economic links to accelerate the green transition while creating new business opportunities for our firms and good employment opportunities for our citizens is a key objective of the TIST.,On 30-31 January 2024, the United States and the European Union jointly organised the “,Crafting the Transatlantic Green Marketplace,” event in Washington, D.C. The event brought together representatives from the U.S. and EU business, civil society, and labor communities to engage in a series of thematic stakeholder-led discussions that focused on identifying opportunities for transatlantic collaboration to promote the transition to a more sustainable and climate-neutral economy on both sides of the Atlantic. The United States and the European Union thank the participants for their time and input. We are currently analysing the various proposals for cooperation received from the stakeholders to assess their potential to be taken forward.,In addition, the United States and the European Union will continue various efforts under the TIST umbrella, including exploring potential avenues of cooperation on conformity assessment.,Green Public Procurement,The United States and the European Union underscore that, by achieving a common understanding on green public procurement practices, we can accelerate the uptake of more sustainable and greener solutions to achieve our common environmental and climate goals.,To this end, we have issued a,Joint U.S.-EU Catalogue of Best Practices on Green Public Procurement,. It will contribute to advancing sustainability objectives by identifying and promoting policy tools for accelerating the deployment of publicly financed sustainability projects in the United States and the European Union.,The Joint Catalogue presents a collection of policies, practices, and actions used across all stages of the procurement process, from the strategic planning to pre-procurement, procurement, and post-contract award stage, and addresses all types of environmental and climate challenges, such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency or promoting circular economy approaches. It can serve as an inspiration for policymakers and suppliers, as well as provide ideas for the uptake of green solutions in public procurement globally.,The United States and the European Union will continue to work together on how to use the Joint Catalogue and maximise its impact.,Secure and Sustainable Supply Chains for the Clean Energy Transition,The United States and the European Union reaffirm that secure and sustainable transatlantic supply chains are key for a solid and steadfast transition towards a net zero economy and will help reduce excessive dependencies in strategic economic activities. We intend to continue to cooperate on strategic supply chains, such as solar, to help us increase secure supply of clean energy. The United States and the European Union share common challenges in the solar sector and reaffirm the importance of a dedicated workstream that explores ways to jointly support our photovoltaic manufacturing capacity (including equipment) and to diversify and de-risk this supply chain.,The United States and the European Union also continue efforts to promote transparency and traceability to improve social standards and environmental protections across supply chains that support the green transition. In this context, we are planning a workshop with stakeholders to present ongoing initiatives to promote innovative solutions in the management of sustainable supply chains, including a focused session on solar.,U.S-EU Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue,The United States and the European Union share a strong commitment to tackling the climate crisis. We want to further the growth of the global clean energy economy while establishing resilient, secure, and diverse clean energy supply chains. By strengthening and expanding clean energy industries and investing in future-oriented sectors, we generate jobs, ignite a positive cycle of innovation, and decrease costs for clean energy technologies.,Through the U.S-EU Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue, we continue to work in a transparent and mutually reinforcing manner, to avoid zero-sum competition, subsidy races and distortions in transatlantic trade and investment flows that could arise from our respective policies and incentives. In this way, we strive to maximise clean energy technology deployment that creates jobs and does not lead to windfalls for private interests. To further enhance transparency, we intend to share specific information about our respective public incentive programs starting with one sector as a pilot with the possibility to extend this to further sectors in the future and will explore putting in place a reciprocal mechanism for consultations.,We share concerns about a range of third country non-market policies and practices. We have discussed thoseused by certain third countries to attain a dominant global position in clean energy sectors, and recognise the value of continuing to exchange information on such non-market policies and practices. We will continue to explore policy tools and possible coordinated action to address harm caused by these policies and practices. including by fostering supply chain diversification, reducing dependencies, and building resilience to economic coercion.,Critical Minerals,The United States and the European Union affirm their close collaboration on diversifying global critical minerals supply chains. We welcome the launch of the,Mineral Security Partnership (,MSP) Forum,, which we will co-chair. The MSP Forum will formalize and expand its existing engagements with minerals producing countries, with a particular focus on advancing and accelerating individual projects with high environmental protections and social governance and labor standards and promoting discussion of policies that contribute to diverse and resilient supply chains.,Continuing our well-established cooperation on critical raw materials, a workshop on “Developing the permanent magnets value chain” resulted in valuable exchanges focussing on rare earth magnets. We plan to continue these exchanges in the future.,To promote a green transition, enhance economic security, and strengthen environmental protections and labor rights in international critical minerals supply chains, the United States and the European Union are advancing negotiations toward a Critical Minerals Agreement.,Transatlantic E-Mobility Cooperation,We welcome the successful completion of the,Electro-mobility and Interoperability with Smart Grids,workstream with the publication of the U.S-EU joint technical recommendations for “,Future Public Demonstrations of Vehicle-Grid Integration (VGI) Pilots,”. Devised in consultation with industry experts and stakeholders, the recommendations propose the development of best practices to prepare for large-scale VGI demonstrations, educate potential customers, and incorporate requisite customer-related factors in demonstration programme designs, and aim at supporting communication and coordination between the United States and the EU.,The recommendations complement the “,Transatlantic Technical Recommendations for Government Funded Implementation of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure,,” which were presented at the fourth TTC ministerial meeting in May 2023 in Luleå, Sweden.,Together, the two sets of recommendations can benefit companies and end users, and transatlantic trade and investment, by supporting the expansion of e-mobility as well as the realization of U.S. and EU clean energy and de-carbonization commitments.,Enhancing eInvoicing Interoperability between the United States and the European Union,As part of our efforts to increase the use of digital tools that enhance trade, Electronic Invoicing (eInvoicing) has emerged as a transformative tool in modern business, offering efficiency gains, cost savings, and trade benefits. The continued cooperation and efforts towards compatible eInvoicing between the United States and the European Union. offer a spectrum of advantages, with the potential to significantly reshape cross-market transactions and the dynamics of transatlantic trade. Even though most of the eInvoicing technical specifications and profiles are highly aligned, there are differences between our respective eInvoicing systems. We intend to continue to cooperate and coordinate for greater compatibility, particularly in terms of business and technical interoperability, as outlined in the declaration annexed to this Joint Statement.,Trade and Labor in the Green Transition,Today, the United States and the European Union held their third session of the tripartite Transatlantic Trade and Labor Dialogue (TALD). This session brought together TTC principals and senior representatives from labor, business, and government from both sides of the Atlantic and continued the joint transatlantic work with social partners on the promotion of sustainable and responsible supply chains with strong protections for labor rights. Building on the discussions during the workshop on the “,Promotion of Good Quality Jobs for a Successful, Just and Inclusive Green Transition,” on 30 January 2024, the TALD meeting provided the opportunity to dive deeper and hear views from labor and business stakeholders on the topic of the green transition, with specific focus on the green transition and other challenges, and the future of TALD.,In addition, the United States and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate to eliminate forced labor from global supply chains, as called upon in the labor and businesses stakeholders’ May 2023 joint recommendations, and they expressed the intention to continue technical dialogue to exchange information, as well as share best practices regarding the implementation of their forced labor policies, including with regard to research and risk assessment.,C. Trade, Security, and Economic Prosperity,Trade for Economic Security,Strengthening our economic security is a fundamental pillar of the transatlantic partnership. The TTC has helped provide a better understanding of our respective approaches to economic security. We intend to continue cooperation under the TTC to address common challenges using relevant trade and technology tools, bilaterally and in relevant fora, including the G7 and the World Trade Organization. We reaffirm shared concerns about the challenges posed to our economic security by, among other issues, economic coercion, the weaponization of economic dependencies, and the use of non-market policies and practices by third countries. We share the objective of continuing efforts to de-risk and diversify our trade and investment relations, including by reducing critical and excessive dependencies and strengthening the resilience of strategic supply chains.,Cooperation on Export Controls and Sanction-Related Export Restrictions,We continue to recognise the important role played by the TTC in supporting the European Union, the United States, and other international partners in their unprecedented cooperation on measures against Russia and Belarus. Such cooperation has helped bring about a continuous alignment of our regulations and a consistent application of export restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus through, for example, regular exchanges of information about authorisation and denial decisions. It has also supported coordination to counter the circumvention of our measures, such as through the creation and update of a common list of high priority items (CHP) and our outreach to industry.,We will continue to work to further align U.S. and EU priorities on Russian export restrictions and coordinated international messaging on those priorities to combat circumvention and improve efficiency and effectiveness of domestic controls. As regards the implementation of export restrictions against Russia, both sides welcome the setting up of the platform for the exchange of licensing information and plan to continue to exchange information on outreach activities, including to third countries and industry.,Both sides have also decided to continue work on facilitating secure high-technology trade and reducing administrative burdens in areas covered by export controls by developing a common understanding of respective rules and mapping out measures that would help streamline this trade, while maintaining a well-functioning and effective export control regime. For example, the United States has expanded licencing exceptions to EU Member States.,We welcome the impulse the TTC has given to coordinated action by the United States and the European Union in reaching out to other countries and supporting them in strengthening their export controls, for example, through the prov",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sion of secure software for the processing of licenses.,Investment Screening,We reiterate the importance of having effective foreign direct investment (FDI) screening mechanisms in place aimed at addressing national security risks in the United States and addressing threats to security and public order in the European Union. We welcome the progress in this regard and will continue to support the development and implementation of these mechanisms, while promoting an open and attractive investment environment.,We have carried out joint work to identify certain best practices on foreign direct investment screening with the intention to eventually bring these to the attention of screening authorities and stakeholders more broadly. We will soon launch of a joint repository that will provide additional resources to U.S. and EU Member State investment screening professionals. We have deepened our cooperation on investment screening through hosting a public stakeholder event and conducting outreach to like-minded partners in the Western Balkans to support their development of effective FDI screening mechanisms and intend to continue such outreach in 2024.,We will continue our cooperation on investment screening through technical exchanges, including on investment trends impacting security risks related to specific sensitive technologies to provide a better understanding of similarities and differences in approach.,Outbound Investment Security,We recognize the importance of investment, innovation, and open economies. At the same time, we are also attentive to concerns regarding potential security threats and risks to international peace and security that may arise from certain outbound investments in a narrow set of critical technologies. Against this background, the United States and the European Union will continue to exchange information on the security risks, risk analyses, and on our respective approaches around this issue, and how to address this new challenge.,Addressing Non-Market Policies and Practices,The United States and the European Union remain concerned about the persistent use of other countries’ non-market policies and practices and the challenge they pose both to our workers and businesses and to other third-country markets. We continue to exchange on the risks that non-market policies and practices, including non-market excess capacity, pose in certain sectors and to engage with partners where appropriate.,We engaged with other countries who share our concerns about China’s non-market policies and practices in the medical devices sector, and conveyed these concerns directly to China. The United States and the European Union will continue to monitor developments in the medical devices sector.,D. Defending Human Rights and Values in a Changing Geopolitical Digital Environment,Protecting Information Integrity in a Pivotal Year for Democratic Resilience,The United States and the European Union reiterate our unwavering commitment to support democracies across the world. We are determined to defend human rights and will continue to call out authoritarianism. In a year marked by democratic elections around the world, we call upon all actors including governments, industry, journalists, human rights defenders, and civil society to protect and defend information integrity both online and offline.,We express our strong support for the role of free, pluralistic, and independent media in protecting information integrity. Independent media should serve as a public watchdog and a key pillar of democracy, as well as an important and dynamic part of our economy. We recognize its indispensable role informing public opinion, fact-checking, and holding those in power accountable.,We are witnessing rapid technological advancements which provide opportunities to enhance information integrity but also create new risks. The United States and the European Union share the concern that malign use of AI applications, such as the creation of harmful “deepfakes,” poses new risks, including to further the spread and targeting of foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI). We call upon technology companies and online platforms to uphold information integrity, including in the run-up to elections across the world.,In the European Union, the Digital Services Act (DSA) requires designated very large online platforms and search engines to assess and mitigate societal risks emanating from their services, including negative effects on civic discourse and electoral processes and recommends specific measures, including on generative AI content.,Cooperation on Online Platforms,The United States and the European Union reaffirm their view that online platforms should exercise greater responsibility in ensuring that their services contribute to an online environment that protects, empowers, and respects their users. We reiterate that online platforms should take appropriate actions to address the impact of their services on the mental health and development of children and youth.,The United States and the European Union also reaffirm that urgent action is needed to address technology-facilitated gender-based violence, which disproportionately impacts women and girls, who often experience multiple and intersecting discriminations and oppressions. We developed a set of,joint principles on combatting gender-based violence on online platforms,that complement further the joint,high-level principles,on the protection and empowerment of children and youth and facilitation of data access from online platforms for independent research, which were released at the fourth TTC ministerial meeting.,In addition to releasing these principles, we are also publishing a,status report,on mechanisms for researcher access to online platform data, which builds upon efforts undertaken by the academic and research community. The aim of this work is to disseminate information about the new and improved possibilities now available to study and understand systemic risks related to online platforms. We call on online platforms to expand and improve access for researchers, particularly on societal risks.,To deepen this work, in the margins of this Ministerial Meeting, we organized a joint workshop on access to platform data and using this data to combat technology-facilitated gender-based violence. We invited, and continue to encourage, the research community to analyse these data access mechanisms, and to explore how they can contribute to a better understanding of the functioning of – and the potential risks emanating from online platforms with regard to areas such as the mental health and development of children and youth, and technology-facilitated gender-based violence.,We share the commitment to the highest appropriate standards of protection in these areas for users in both the United States and the European Union.,Protecting Human Rights Defenders Online,The United States and the European Union recognise the key role human rights defenders (HRDs) play in defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, and we are committed to the protection of HRDs online and offline. We are working together to address human rights risks stemming from the misuse of digital technologies, including combatting internet shutdowns, unlawful surveillance, and the targeting of HRDs online. Elevating the critical role of HRDs and supporting and protecting them in doing their work safely is not only a shared foreign policy priority for the United States and the European Union, but an imperative for advancing human rights for all.,Following the commitment made at the fourth TTC ministerial meeting, we have published joint,Recommended Actions for Online Platforms on Protecting Human Rights Defenders Online,. This document sets out ten recommendations that online platforms can take globally to prevent, mitigate, and provide remedy for attacks against HRDs online.,These recommendations reflect commitments we made with global partners through the Declaration of the Future of the Internet and reflect key principles of U.S. and EU legislation, initiatives, and policies to safeguard human rights online. They were informed by extensive stakeholder consultations organized by the United States and the European Union from January 2023 to February 2024. The United States and the European Union intend to take further actions to address the needs of HRDs around the world. We will engage with all relevant stakeholders to promote the recommended actions and facilitate their implementation. We will also facilitate further exchanges and cooperation between the European Union- and United States-based emergency mechanisms on support strategies which seek to prevent, curb, mitigate, and eliminate online attacks, including the use of arbitrary and unlawful surveillance targeting HRDs.,Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference in Third Countries,The United States and the European Union consider foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI) to be geopolitical and security challenges. We share the aim of addressing this threat and enhancing the resilience of democracies. Against this background, we have taken a number of actions to increase transatlantic cooperation to proactively address FIMI, including disinformation, while upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms. We will continue to work together to address FIMI through the TTC and other multi- and bilateral contexts.,We will continue to jointly use and further advance,the common analytical methodology to identify, analyse and detect FIMI,decided at the fourth TTC ministerial meeting. We are engaging with other international partners on a quarterly basis to familiarise them with this methodology. Expanding the network of partners familiar with this methodology will enhance our common understanding of the threat and allow us to jointly identify, analyse, and counter FIMI globally.,The European Union, the United States, and the Western Balkan partners share the same vision for an open, reliable, and secure Internet, as evidenced by their joint endorsement of the Declaration for the Future of the Internet. We will coordinate our efforts in order to support the Western Balkan partners by launching a coordination mechanism to address FIMI threats more effectively in the region. This is in line with the European Union’s and like-minded partners’ initiatives to increase their capabilities to further identify, assess, and counter FIMI. Our support will reduce third countries’, and in particular Russia’s and other actors’, including China’s, ability to effectively employ FIMI campaigns in the region. We will help our partners in the Western Balkans to develop capacity in five key action areas: the development of national strategies and policies, the creation of dedicated governance structures and institutions, increasing human and technical capabilities, protecting and supporting the role of independent media, academia, and civil society, and multilateral engagement.,Secure and Trusted Digital Infrastructure and Connectivity in Third Countries,The United States and the European Union reiterate the importance of and support for secure, trusted, and resilient digital connectivity and information and communication technology and services (ICTS) supply chains in third countries, provided by trusted suppliers.,We commend the decisions taken by partner countries towards trusted ICT ecosystems by ensuring high cybersecurity and resilience standards for connectivity solutions and networks, including by restricting or excluding high-risk suppliers from their national networks and using trusted vendors and services providers for maintenance and repair.,We will continue to reach out to partners across the world to understand the needs and challenges around securing digital infrastructure and explore how we can best collaborate to support the digitalisation goals of emerging economies. We continue to engage emerging economies through technical discussions and high-level roundtables to increase interest in secure digital connectivity. We also remain committed to continued exchanges with relevant industry actors such as mobile network operators and trusted equipment suppliers.,We are delivering on our commitments to support to secure and resilient connectivity projects in Costa Rica, Jamaica, Kenya, and the Philippines, including through mechanisms like the Global Gateway, the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, and technical exchanges, including third counties sharing experiences to accelerate secure connectivity in other parts of the region.,The United States and the European Union are supporting Tunisia’s goal of establishing secure digital connectivity and infrastructure by relying on trusted vendors through collaborative advocacy, technical assistance and by exploring financing, coordination, and policy alignment. This includes providing training programs to targeted Tunisian government agencies, IT professionals, and businesses, and promoting the development of cybersecurity standards and frameworks, in particular for 5G. The United States and the European Union are advancing discussions with relevant financial institutions for the mobilisation of support for secure digital connectivity infrastructure projects with trusted vendors.,We aim to continue our actions to support secure and resilient digital connectivity in third countries. Following the earlier signing of a memorandum of understanding between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the United States and the European Union intend to augment their actions by furthering cooperation between the EU Member State and United States financing agencies. In 2023, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) signed co-financing memorandums of understanding with the Swedish EKN and Finnish Finnvera respectively to facilitate joint support for export projects, and has enabled direct support to trusted suppliers from both sides.,We are committed to exploring options to act strategically, cooperatively, and efficiently to provide attractive incentives to partner countries to choose trusted suppliers for the development of their connectivity networks.,Secure and Resilient International Connectivity,The United States and the European Union recall the economic and geostrategic importance of cooperating on trust and security in the entirety of ICT infrastructure, including maintenance and repair. To this end, we continue to seek ways to advance cooperation on international connectivity with trustworthy, secure, and resilient networks. This could include trans-oceanic routes including through the Arctic and Pacific regions.,III.,Building the Transatlantic Partnership Together with Stakeholders,We remain committed to high levels of transparency and the close involvement of the transatlantic stakeholder community at large in the work of the TTC, including businesses, labor organisations, non-profit organisations, environmental constituencies, and academics.,We have therefore extensively reached out to stakeholders and given them the possibility to be involved and to provide input and receive feedback through the organisation of events, roundtables, and workshops and the establishment of dedicated websites like,Futurium,. With the support of the EU-financed Trade and Technology Dialogue, several high-level events have taken place and stakeholders have been consulted on topics such as sustainable trade, standardisation, AI, connectivity, and semiconductors.,In addition to these activities, we have also engaged with relevant stakeholders in more structured formats such as the Transatlantic Trade and Labor Dialogue, the Talent for Growth Task Force, and with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in a series of webinars on the topic of SME access to and use of digital tools.,Talent for Growth,The Talent for Growth Task Force, launched in April 2023 with a one-year mandate, has served both as a platform for best practices and a catalyst for innovative skills approaches that promote economic growth and create opportunities for workers in the technology sector. The Task Force brought together leaders from government, business, labor unions, and organisations that support training from the United States and the European Union. The Task Force identified, mapped, and disseminated implementable models and ideas in four critical areas: t,raining workers to meet business needs, including women and underrepresented groups in technical jobs, Moving to a skills-first culture, and micro-credentials.,The Task Force endorsed a,statement,featuring key messages stemming from these discussions.,The discussions in this group have confirmed the critical role talent plays for the sustainable growth of our economies and the well-being of our societies in an age of rapidly changing technology. It examined the acceleration of change brought about by AI. The Task Force has established bilateral relations between Task Force members which have catalysed private-sector initiatives and will last beyond the timeframe of the Task Force. The European and the United States remain dedicated to continuing to equip our workforces with the skills necessary to meet the needs created by rapidly changing technology, including AI.,Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs),The United States and the European Union recognise the use of digital tools as a key enabler for SMEs to innovate, grow, and compete and are continuing their work to promote the uptake of digital technologies by SMEs.,Several webinars and outreach activities where SMEs shared their needs and experience were held during the last two years. After an analysis of these stakeholder exchanges, we have developed a,common set of recommendations,for U.S. and EU policymakers to implement measures to help SMEs to accelerate access to these technologies.,The recommendations focus on the topics of digital-related trainings; transatlantic exchange programmes; information-sharing on cyber-security, intellectual property, and standards; and access to finance. To continue the work, we intend to develop an implementation process for these recommendations, including measures such as a webinar on access to finance and the publishing of cross-referenced U.S. and EU websites with practical information for SMEs.,IV.,Conclusion and Next Steps,Since its inaugural meeting on 29 September 2021, the TTC has realized substantial progress and achievements across all workstreams. These results have enabled the United States and the European Union: to explore how to create new trade and investment opportunities, notably to contribute to the green transition; to advance our shared leadership in emerging technologies, such as 6G, quantum, and biotechnology so that democracies can remain at the vanguard of these developments; to provide a robust joint response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine; to cooperate on economic security measures to reduce economic dependencies; to continue to develop a shared understanding of the non-market policies and practices and the risks they pose or our workers, businesses and markets globally; to jointly enhance supply chain resilience while promoting transparency and cooperation on our industrial policy approaches in key sectors, including semiconductors and clean energy; to exchange information on best practices in eliminating forced labor from our global supply chains; to advance and reinforce interoperability between AI governance frameworks based on our shared democratic values to achieve our common vision for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI globally ; to advance the resilience and security of our ICT infrastructures; and to finance and promote secure connectivity with trusted suppliers around the world.,These achievements demonstrate the enduring ties between the United States and the European Union and the importance of maintaining an operational forum for cooperation on strategic trade and technology issues of common interest and geopolitical relevance. As the United States and the European Union enter their respective electoral processes, the work we do under the TTC will remain relevant, strategic, and timely, while allowing for the necessary flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.,Building on the lessons learned from our cooperation so far, we intend to use the remainder of 2024 to engage with U.S. and EU stakeholders to learn their views on the future of the TTC.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington," DC 20500""",05-04-24,U.S-EU Joint Statement of the Trade and Technology Council,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/05/u-s-eu-joint-statement-of-the-trade-and-technology-council-3/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reason I did is — I think I understand a little bit what many of you have gone through and what you’re trying to help with.,You know, when I got elected, I was 26 — 29 years old.  I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in.  While I was down here hiring staff, before I was sworn in, I got a call saying my wife and daughter were dead and my two boys were badly injured.  And so, you know, I — I wasn’t going to come down, but I had a — thank God, I had a family and a lot of friends and older men- — members like me, 45, 50 — (laughter) — who helped me out.,But all — but all kidding aside, I didn’t have them — I was just — I just had started a law practice.  I didn’t have any money.  I mean, I made a living, but I didn’t have any money.  And what I tried to do is figure out how I was going to raise my boys.,AUDIENCE MEMBERS:  Wooo!,THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m serious.,And I tell you what, I really wondered: Why did I commute every single day?  Over a million miles roundtrip over the time I was in the United States Senate.,And the reason I did: I couldn’t afford a house down here without selling my house at home, and I couldn’t afford caregiving.  It was the God’s truth.  No possibility.  None whatsoever.,But I — lucky I had a family.  My mother, my father, my sister, my brother all moved in, helped me take care of my kids.  But then we ended up with Mom getting sick and Dad getting sick, and they — we took care of them — the so-called sandwich generation.,Look, you care workers represent the best of who we are as Americans.  (Applause.)  No, you really do.  We look out for one another in America.  We leave nobody behind — nobody behind.,And you said — all the heroes in the lives you was — talk about.  Well, you’re our hero.  You’re the heroes to so many individuals.  You really are.  And you represent so many people who do it — and do it out of love and concern, not because of the pay, because they’re not getting the pay they need.  It matters.  (Laughter.),As your President, I’m here with a simple message.  I give you my word: I have your back.  I have your back.  (Applause.),I also to thank the family of Ady Barkan, whose widow Rachael and her son here — Carl — are here, just backstage.  I just met with them.  Their family embodies why care matters.  It’s critical to the dignity of care, the dignity of all — all caregivers and workers.,My dad used to say, “A job — Joey” — I give you my word as a (inaudible).  “A job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect.”  (Applause.)  No, it really is.  “It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’”,Care workers and caregivers are critical to our families and to the entire economy.  That’s why as a candidate, as president I was determined to turn things around.  We’ve made progress, but there’s so more that we have to do — so much more.,If we want the best economy in the world, we have to have the best caregiving economy in the world.  (Applause.)  We really do.  They are not inconsistent.  They are consistent.,But the cost of care is too high and pay for care workers is much too low.  (Applause.),Take childcare.  A typical family spends $11,000 a year on childcare per child — per child.  If you live in a big city, that can be $17,000 for each child — more than their college tuition if, God willing, you’re able to get there.  And a lot of parents do the math and realize they can’t afford to go to work, because childcare can sometimes literally cost more than they earn — more than they earn.,You know, take homecare.  The cost of long-term care for aging loved ones and people with disabilities rose 40 percent in the last decade.,Medicaid offers help, but it can’t meet the demand.  You know, there are 700,000 seniors waiting in line — 700,000 waiting in line, and people with disabilities are stuck on Medicaid homecare waiting lists for as long as 10 years if they survive to be qualifi- — it’s amazing.  Think about it.,Family members like ours and yours often spend their own retirement savings to pay for the care of the loved ones.  Others leave their jobs to care for them.  And millions are part of the so-called sandwich generation, taking care of both your kids and your aging parents at the same time — at least that’s been the experience of the Biden family.  It’s overwhelming.,Take paid leave.  We’re the only ad- — (applause) — we’re — we’re the — we’re the only advanced economy in the world not to guarantee paid leave.  We’re going to change that.  (Applause.)  That means to help a loved one, many folks have to leave work,to,[or] find out later that they’ve been fired.,In the United States of America, no one — no one should choose between caring for a parent who’s raised them, a child who depends on them, or a paycheck that they need.  (Applause.)  That’s not why it should be — the way it should be.,No, I’m serious.  You wonder whether I feel strongly about this, I do.,Look, more often than not, from childcare to eldercare to the lack of paid leave, it’s women who bear the brunt — (applause) — women who bear the brunt.,We saw that during the pandemic when 2 million women left their jobs to help take care of their families.  It hurts our whole economy to lose so much talent in the workplace.  And it keeps women from earning the equal pay they deserve because they say, “Well, you haven’t been here.”,Look, a fact: Care workers are predominately women as well — women of color and immigrants who are overworked, overlooked, and underpaid.  (Applause.)  It’s not enough just to praise them for all they’re doing; we have to pay them.  (Applause.),To invest in our care economy, as soon as I came into office, I signed the American Rescue Plan.  Not a single Republican voted for it, I might add — not one.,It made our nation’s biggest investment in childcare ever.  (Applause.)  For example, it kept 225,000 childcare workers — cen- — well, childcare,working,centers open, giving parents an opportunity —,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.),THE PRESIDENT:  — to get back to work.,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.),THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I tell you what — you want to come make a speech or shush up?  Okay?  (Laughter.)  I’m not messing around with him.  He — he lo- — he looks like he could take me.,AFSCME!  (Applause.),Look, it expanded the Childcare Tax Credit, cutting child poverty in America in half.  That’s what it did.  We cut it in half.  (Applause.),Overall, my administration increased funding for nearly 50 percent for — of — by 50 percent for childcare.  And in the coming weeks, we plan to release new rules to strengthen staffing standards in nursing homes, to get homecare workers a bigger share of Medicaid payments.  (Applause.),But I want to — but that’s not going to be enough.  I want to do more, and we can do more.,My budget for next year makes key commitments to children, seniors, and people with disabilities, and to caregivers who look after their loved ones.  (Applause.),First, for working families with small children, we’re going to guarantee affordable, quality childcare.  (Applause.)  Most families — under our plan, most families will pay less than $10 a day per child, saving millions of folks as much as $7,000 a year.  That’s a lot of breathing room for a — young families who need it badly.  (Applause.),We’ll also restore the expanded Childcare Tax Credit — (applause) — lifting millions of children out of poverty.  And, by the way, this helps the economy.  It doesn’t hurt the — it helps the economy.  (Applause.),You know, our Republican friends let that expire.  Well, we got to expire a couple of them, politically — (laughter and applause) — in order to get this passed.,Together, we’re going to bring it back.  (Applause.),Second, seniors and people with disabilities, we’re going to expand Medicaid homecare services and reduce that 700,000-person backlog.  (Applause.)  That’ll mean more folks can live and work in their own communities with dignity and independence.  More homecare workers will start getting a better pay and benefits and dignity they deserve.  (Applause.),By the way, if anybody is listening besides all of us, we agree on this: This is really — I’m — we’re deadly earnest.  This is not — it’s not a joke.  This matters.  (Applause.),Third, for everyone caring for a loved one, my budget would finally, finally create a national paid family and medical leave program — finally — (applause) — up to 12 weeks to care for a newborn, a sick on- — a sick loved one, or yourself without losing your income.  (Applause.),Look, it’s past time America caught up with the rest of the world on paid leave.  (Applause.),And, folks, all this helps families, and it grows the economy.  It grows the economy.  And we can afford to do it.  To put another way, we can’t afford not to do it.,Look, I’m a capitalist.  But I want to make sure that — you know, if you make a million bucks, great.  Just start paying your fair share in taxes.  (Applause.),But let me ask you: Does anyone here think the tax code is fair?  Raise your hand.,AUDIENCE:  No!,THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t either.  (Laughter.),The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut —,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  — overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the federal deficit more than any other president has.  We’ve cut the deficit, by the way.  (Applause.),It added more to the national debt than any presidential term in history.  And it’s due to expire next year.  And guess what?  I hope to be president because it expires, it’s going to stay expired — (applause) — stay expired.,Our administration — our administration has already cut the deficit by $1 trillion.  And I’m going to cut it even more this decade by making big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share.  (Applause.),Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an extra penny in taxes.  I don’t — I hope that (inaudible).  (Applause.),As I’ve made it clear: We’re not trying to beat people — there a- — but there are a thousand billionaires in America — from 750 to 1,000 since the pandemic.  You know what the average tax rate those billionaires pay?  8.2 percent.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m serious.  Anybody want to trade that tax rate?,AUDIENCE:  Yes!,THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, that’s far less than the vast majority of Americans pay.  No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, or a care worker.  (Applause.),And that’s why I proposed a minimum tax for billionaires of 25 percent.  It’s not even the highest rate — just 25 percent.  And guess what?  It’s more fair.  But it also — guess what it would do over 10 years?  It would raise $500 billion — (applause) — $500 billion.  And it wouldn’t hurt anybody.,I’m a capitalist.  If you make a billion bucks, wonderful.  Pay your fair share.  (Applause.),Imagine what we can do — imagine what we can do for America.  Look, folks, imagine a future with affordable childcare, homecare, eldercare, paid leave.,But, folks, our Republican friends have a different vision.  Republicans in the House of Representatives — and, by the way, Rosa DeLauro — she was here, I was told — she’s a hell of a champion for all this.  (Applause.),They just released their budget — the Republicans — that cuts caregiving programs by a third — the ones that exist, cuts them by a third.  For example, it would mean 260,000 fewer kids in childcare.,My predecessor and his MAGA friends want to — I love the phrase — the — the language they use — they want to “terminate” the Affordable Care Act.,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  “Terminate.”  Well, guess what?  Killing millions of Americans — taking them off of healthcare insurance and stripping others of services like homecare.,Folks — and, by the way, you know how many times they’ve tried to take out Obamacare and the Affordable Healthcare Act?  Forty-nine times they’ve tried.  They can keep trying, but they’re not going to get it done.  (Applause.),And, look, when it comes to Social Security and Medicare, my predecessor recently said, quote, “There’s a lot you can do in terms of cutting.”  God love him.,Right on cue, House Republicans released their budget that would raise the retirement age in Social Security — the budget they submitted for next year — and slash Medicare, while they cut taxes for the very wealthy again.,I got a better idea.  I’ll protect Social Security and Medicare and make the very wealthy pay their fair share to make it work.  (Applause.),Look, let me conclude where I started, by thanking all of you.  As Crystal said, you’re all — and I mean this sincerely — you’re all somebody’s hero.,That’s what I see in our nation’s caregivers: heroes.  We need you.  Not a joke.  We need you.  (Applause.),And together, I know we can do this.  I’ve never been more optimistic about our future.  We just have to remember who we are.  We’re the United States of America.  There’s nothing beyond our capacity — nothing — (applause) — if we do it together.,So, let’s stay work- — get to work, keep working.  And God bless you all.  And may God bless our troops.,Thank you.

Families should be able to:,Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting policy and implementation actions that the Federal Government has taken to improve benefits access.  These actions include both policy changes, like simplifying applications and eliminating waiting periods, and implementation actions, like helping states reduce application backlogs and enabling data sharing across programs.

JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.,Q    Good afternoon.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, okay.  Well, thank you.  (Laughter.),So, I want to start by addressing some devastating and alarming news from the Arizona Supreme Court.,With today’s decision, millions of Arizonians will soon face an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban than they did before.  This Arizona law, which was initially enacted in 1864, more than 150 years ago, fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in horrific cases of rape or incest.,There are now 21 extreme state abortion bans in effect across the country.  One third of all women of reproductive age now live in a state with an abortion ban.,And all of these bans, including the one upheld today that was upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court, are a direct result of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.,When the President’s predecessor,handicapped,[handpicked] three Supreme Court justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, it paved the way for the chaos and confusion we’re seeing play out across the country today.,President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to choose.  And they will continue to fight to protect reproductive rights and call on Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade for women in every state.,On the topic of healthcare, you just heard from the President earlier today.  He marked Care Workers Recognition Month by joining care workers, union members, and advocates to highlight his administration’s work to make care more affordable for American families, support family caregivers, boost compensation and job quality for care workers, and expand care options.,Through the first-ever care EO signed by President Biden just last year, as well as through the American Rescue Plan and the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan-Har- — the Bi- — pardon me — the Biden-Harris administration is marking transformational investment in childcare, homecare, paid family and medical leave, and tax cuts for workers and families.  And the President’s plan would pay for these investments in working families by making billionaires and the biggest corporations pay their fair share.,That is in sharp contrast with congressional Republicans, who released a budget that would make devastating cuts in funding for childcare, Head Start, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare — all to pay for massive tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.,Care workers play an essential role in our economy, and President Biden will never stop fighting for them.,Finally, today, the President spoke with UConn Coach Dan Hurley and congratulated him on last night’s championship.,The UConn Huskies had an incredible year, which culminated in a series of dominant performances in the NCAA tournament.  UConn is the first team to win back-to-back championships in the men’s bracket since the University of Florida accomplished this feat in 2006 and 2007.,We also congratulated Coach Dawn Staley and the University of South Carolina on their undefeated season and national championship.  The women’s tournament featured fantastic games and generated record ratings.,It was really a March Madness to remember.  We congratulate the University of South Carolina, UConn, and the atle- — athletes on their victories.,With that, as you can see, we have the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, who is here to speak about the Ja- — Japanese — the Japan state visit that’s happening starting today and also talk about the developments around the world.,Jake.,MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know you’re, like, much taller than me.,MR. SULLIVAN:  Thanks, Karine.,Thank you, Karine.  And thanks, everybody.  I’ve got some opening comments on the Japan state visit and — and a couple of other topics, and then I’d be happy to take your questions.,Starting this evening, the President and First Lady will welcome Prime Minister Kishida and Mrs. Kishida to the White House for an official visit and state dinner.,From the very outset of the Biden administration, we have focused on reinvesting in and reinvigorating our alliances.  And nowhere has the strength and vibrancy of that strategy been on display more than in the Indo-Pacific and especially with Japan.,The two leaders, President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida, have met nearly a dozen times over the past three years, in Tokyo and Washington and in cities around the world.  And this official state visit will build on the immense progress between our two nations that we’ve made towards creating a safer and more secure Indo-Pacific as well as mutual prosperity for our peoples.,Over the course of the visit, the President and the Prime Minister will highlight the high ambition of our alliance — yes, in the defense and technology space but also across the board — deepening our partnerships on space, technology, economic investment, fighting climate change, coordinating global diplomacy, and strengthening our people-to-people ties.,I’ll briefly touch on some of what you can expect the two leaders to announce.,They will announce measures to enhance our defense and security cooperation to enable greater coordination and integration of our forces and ensure that they are optimally postured and linked to other like-minded partners.,There will be major deliverables on space, as we lead the way on space exploration and returning to the Moon.,There will be announcements of significant research partnerships between our leading institutions on critical and emerging technologies, such as AI, quantum, semiconductors, and clean energy.  All of this will strengthen our economic ties and economic security as we announce significant commercial deals as part of the state visit.,Japan is one of the largest providers of economic assistance and budget support to Ukraine, one of the largest investors in development and infrastructure in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.  And this visit will highlight Japan’s continued role in global diplomacy and development and the coordination that the U.S. and Japan have together with significant deliverables on global assistance and investment both inside and outside the Indo-Pacific.,And we’ll also announce new initiatives to further foster — foster our cultural connections and promote ties between current changemakers and future generations of leaders.,Following the important visit that Prime Minister Kishida is initiating this evening and that will carry through tomorrow, President Biden will welcome President Marcos of the Philippines to the White House on Thursday for his second bilateral meeting at the White House in as many years.,President Biden will also host the first-ever trilateral leaders’ summit between the United States, Japan, and the Philippines.,The U.S., Japan, and the Philippines are three closely aligned maritime democracies with increasingly convergent strategic objectives and interests.  Just this past week, our three countries and Australia held joint naval drills in the South China Sea.,When I met with my Japanese and Filipino counterparts in Tokyo last June, we agreed to enhance our nations’ trilateral partnership.  And this week is a culmination of months of effort since that meeting in Tokyo last June.,The three leaders will announce new initiatives to enhance energy security, economic and maritime cooperation, partnerships on technology and cybersecurity, and joint investments in critical infrastructure.,And with this first-ever leaders trilateral, we’re continuing to deepen our cooperation with our closest partners to ensure what we’ve talked about many times from this podium and elsewhere: a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.,Over the past three years, the President has achieved historic breakthroughs across the region — across the Indo-Pacific.  He’s launched AUKUS; elevated the Quad; brought the U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral to new heights; upgraded relations with ASEAN, Vietnam, and Indonesia; and hosted two Pacific Island summits and one ASEAN summit here at the White House.,And we look forward to adding another momentous chapter to this story with both the state visit that Prime Minister Kishida has embarked upon and this historic trilateral meeting among the U.S., Japan, and the Philippines.,I also want to take a moment before going to your questions to address the events of April 5th in Quito, Ecuador.,We condemn this violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, including the use of force against embassy officials.  We’ve reviewed the security camera footage from the Mexican embassy and believe these actions were wrong.,The Ecuadorian government disregarded its obligations under international law as a host state to respect the inviolability of diplomatic missions and jeopardized the foundation of basic diplomatic norms and relationships.,We’ve asked Ecuador to work with Mexico to find a resolution to this diplomatic dispute.  And to that end, we welcome the Organization of American States Permanent Council meeting this week to help reach a peaceful, diplomatic solution.,Finally, let me say something on an important issue that’s moving through the House this week: reauthorization of 702 of FISA.  The administration strongly supports the bipartisan bill, whose text is now with the Rules Committee, to reauthorize this essential intelligence authority and other FISA provisions before they would expire on April 19th.,If we lost 702, we would lose vital insight into precisely the threats Americans expect us in government to identify and counter: terrorist threats to the homeland; fentanyl supply chains bringing deadly drugs into American communities; hostile governments’ recruitment of spies in our midst; transnational repression by authoritarian regimes; penetrations of our critical infrastructure; adversaries’ attempts to illicitly acquire sensitive dual-use and military commodities and technology; ransomware attacks against major American companies and nonprofits; Russian war crimes; and more.,So, to protect the American people, we need to maintain this vital collection authority, while strengthening its protective guardrails with the most robust set of reforms ever included in leger- — legislation to reauthorize Section 702.  And this bill does that.,For these same reasons, the administration strongly opposes the amendment we anticipate being offered that would rebuild a wall around, and thus block access to, already lawfully collected information in the possession of the U.S. government.,The amendment, if it looks like what we’ve seen before, would prohibit U.S. officials from reviewing critical information that the intelligence community has already lawfully collected, with only exceptions that are exceedingly narrow and unworkable in practice.,Our intelligence, defense, and public safety communities are united: The extensive harms of this proposal simply cannot be mitigated.  And so, the administration strongly opposes the amendment.  But we strongly support the underlying bipartisan bill, whose text is now with the Rules Committee.,With that, I would be happy to take your questions.,Yeah.,Q    Thank you.  The White House is still reserving judgment on the IDF report on the killing of — of the World Central Kitchen aid workers.  Why?  Why is this review taking so long?,MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, that report just came out last week.  And what I have done is asked an interagency team of experts who actually have knowledge of the humanitarian, operational, oth- — other elements of this to look at the circumstances, to look at the findings of the report, and then to come up with some judgments as a result of that.,This isn’t a formal process.  It’s an informal review.  And as we gain some judgments from that, we’ll be prepared to share them with you.  But that process is underway now.,Q    How long does — is it going to take?,MR. SULLIVAN:  I can’t tell you exactly how long it’s going to take.,Yeah.,Q    Jake, could you update us where — where things stand on the latest hostage negotiations?  Is any real progress being made?  I think Hamas rejected the latest proposal.  Are both sides making the kind of concessions that are going to be necessary?,MR. SULLIVAN:  As you know, Bill Burns was in Cairo on Sunday.  There was a marathon session that went late into the night among the United States, Israel, Qatar, and Egypt.  Qatar and Egypt, of course, were communicating with Hamas through this process.  And we have seen Israel take some steps forward in terms of what they’re putting on the table.  And, of course, we’ve seen the public statements from Hamas that have been, shall we say, less than encouraging.,But I spoke with the Prime Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed, this morning.  He does not yet have an answer from Hamas.  I pressed him to try to secure an answer from them as soon as possible.  And when we have more to report on that front, we will report it to you.,Yeah.,Q    Thank you, Jake.,Q    Two things.  Prime Minister Netanyahu says he has a date for the Rafah operation.  Will the administration take any action or restrict military support for Israel if Netanyahu moves forward on Rafah?,MR. SULLIVAN:  If he has a date, he hasn’t shared it with us.  So, I’ve seen his public comments, but I have nothing more on that front.,I’m not going to comment on hypotheticals, but I will state here what I stated the last time I stood at this podium, which is that the United States does not believe that a massive ground invasion of Rafah — where 1.3 or more million people are sheltering, having been pushed out of other parts of Gaza that are now destroyed, into the area where humanitarian assistance comes in — this is not the best way forward.,There are better ways to go after Hamas in Rafah.  We presented those ways to our Israeli counterparts in a session we held last week.  There have been ongoing technical talks between our teams since then, and I anticipate we’ll have another opportunity at senior levels to engage them in Rafah and that conversation will stay ongoing.  And then we will make determinations about how we proceed based on how those conversations unfold.,Yeah.,Q    To follow up on that, Jake.  If the U.S. is not even being looped in on the date for when this military operation is set to take place, why do you think the U.S. has any influence in those upcoming meetings to change Israel’s strategy?,MR. SULLIVAN:  First of all, when you talk about “looped in,” the Prime Minister makes public statements.  He also talks to us in private about aspects of operations, about their thinking with respect to Rafah, in some considerable detail.,I sat in the Situation Room not long ago on a secured video conference that went on for hours going into specifics on this.,So, I can’t speak to every public comment he makes.  What I can tell you is that we have open channels of communication with the Israelis on these issues.  They understand our position.  And we have been very clear about our deep and abiding concerns about a Rafah operation and our belief that there are better ways to deal with the strategic threat Hamas poses than some of the ideas that have been put forward.  And our further belief that any kind of plan to protect civilians in a serious way in Rafah, that’s something we have yet to see be presented to us.,And so, our concerns continue.  And now we will have to wait and see what happens.  And the United States will respond accordingly.,Yeah.,Q    There’s a report out today that the Israeli government plans to purchase 40,000 tents ahead of its invasion of Rafah.  Has the U.S. seen any sort of an evacuation plan, particularly one involving those tents?,MR. SULLIVAN:  As I said just in the answer to the last question, I have not yet seen a credible and executable plan to move people that has the — any level of detail about how you not only house, feed, and provide medicine for those innocent civilians but also how you deal with things like sanitation, water, and other basic services.  We have not seen that yet.,Q    Do you think —,MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.,Q    — 40,000 tents would be sufficient?  Would more be needed?,MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m not going to stand at the podium and substitute for the judgment of humanitarian experts who could speak to what precisely on the shelter front, as well as on all of these other fronts I just described, would be sufficient.  So, I just can’t react in real time to news reports like that.,Yeah.,Q    On — on the Japan visit tomorrow.  The President has said to U.S. Steel workers, “I have your back.  I mean it.”  What is his message to the Prime Minister tomorrow about the potential acquisition of U.S. Steel?  How strongly will the President convey his opposition?  And will there be any specific things that the President will either urge the Prime Minister to do or will say steps that he’s willing to take to prevent — prevent an acquisition?,MR. SULLIVAN:  You guys all know Joe Biden.  You’ve seen Joe Biden.  He’s been very clear that he’s going to stand up for American workers, he’s going to defend their interests.  He’s also been very clear that he is going to make sure that the U.S.-Japan alliance is the strongest it’s ever been.  He’s going to accomplish both of those things.,That’s what he has set out to do as President.  That’s what he’ll continue to do.  And I — I won’t comment further on the — the specifics of diplomatic conversations between the two leaders.,Yeah.,Q    Jake, can you give us a better understanding — what is the U.S.’s assessment of the troop withdrawal we’ve seen by the Israelis recently from Gaza?  Is this in response to pressure from the United States?  Was there any commitment made to the U.S. there, or is this a way of trying to advance negotiations with Hamas?  And do you view this as a change in the way Israel is prosecuting its war there?,MR. SULLIVAN:  You’ll have to speak with the Israelis about the purpose or motive behind their particular operational moves.  I’m not going to characterize that from the podium.  What I will say —,Q    So, you don’t think — there has been no private commitment made to you that “we will remove troops” based on the conversation you had or after months of pressure —,MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m —,Q    — to help —,MR. SULLIVAN:  As you might expect, I’m also not going to get into private diplomatic conversations between the President and the Prime Minister.  But what I will say is that a reduction in the intensity and scope of military operations does create a greater opening for the movement of humanitarian goods around Gaza at a critical moment when there is a real humanitarian crisis there.,So, we welcome the opportunity to move more trucks in and then move more trucks around Gaza so that the innocent people, innocent civilians there can get the food, water, medicine, and other essentials that they need for their —,Q    You also welcomed Erez and Ashdod — the announcement that was made by the Prime Minister — or by the Israelis last week.  Neither of them have opened now approaching a week since then.  Are you satisfied with this timetable?  We were told that the U.S. — from your colleague, John Kirby — needed to see action within hours or days.  It’s now days, but certainly well beyond hours.  Are you satisfied by the pace of this?  And what commitments has the U.S. been made about how soon that will occur?,MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, just to take the — the opening point of your question, which is that we welcome these steps.  What we actually said very clearly from the first minute was: Israel has made public statements; now we need to see them follow through with action and that action needs to be specific, concrete, and measurable.,And that goes for the opening of a crossing into northern Gaza from Israel.  It goes for the opening of Ashdod port.  When it comes to those two things, we will watch to see what unfolds over the next few days.,What John Kirby was talking about in terms of hours was a step change in the willingness of the Israeli government to take action to get more aid into Gaza.  And if you look at the last two days, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of aid going into Gaza.  That’s good.  It is not good enough.,We would like to see more action following through on what the Prime Minister has announced publicly, and we’d like to see that over the course of the next few days.,Q    Thank you.,MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.,Q    Thank you, Jake.  CNN has reported that the U.S. is bracing for a retaliatory attack by Iran in the Middle East.  What can you tell us about your current assessment, whether that’s inevitable and what the U.S. is doing to safeguard its assets there?,MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we are watching public statements by Iranian officials, public reports of Iranian plans to potentially take retaliatory action.  And we have made clear that as the President said to the Prime Minister and as was read out in his call that America’s support for Israel’s security is ironclad and America’s support for Israel’s defense against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad.,And I’m not going to speak to operational details beyond that.,Yeah.,Q    And on Ukraine.  Speaker Johnson has said that he will pursue what he described as “innovations” to the Senate package.  Has the White House has been briefed on what those innovations are and whether the President could support any of them?,MR. SULLIVAN:  We — our teams — between the White House and Speaker Johnson’s teams as well as with the other leaders in both the House and the Senate — have had ongoing discussions about how we get a bipartisan — a bill that is supported on a bipartisan basis passed by 70 votes in the Senate.  We believe it could be passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in the House, actually on to the floor and voted upon.,And I’m not going to speak to the specifics of those conversations because I don’t want to negotiate from the podium.,Yeah.,Q    Thanks, Jake.  Just on Russia.  Russian investigators said today they’re opening a probe into the financing of terrorism that they say involves Western countries, specifically including funds received by the firm Burisma, by which Hunter Biden was employed.  What’s your comment on that?  Is that just a political ploy or what — how do you view that?,MR. SULLIVAN:  I mean, it’s nonsense.  Russia knows that it was ISIS who committed the attack in Moscow.  We know it was ISIS who committed the attack in Moscow.  We warned Russia of an impending terrorist attack in Moscow.  And all of the rest of this is noise.,Yeah.,Q    And just very briefly — very briefly, if I may.  Yesterday, David Cameron, the British Foreign Secretary, met with Donald Trump.  What’s your — what’s your view on that?  Is the President concerned to see him meeting a potential election rival?,MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m not going to speak to campaign-related issues — Hatch Act.  So, I’ll plead that and move on.,Yeah.,Q    Thank you.  So, you are saying that changes from Israel are good, but not good enough.  So, to pursue more changes, are you going to do something besides talking to them?,MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, what the President said on Friday is that our policy will be determined by the actions that we see unfold.  We’ve seen them take some actions.  We would like to see more actions.  And as Secretary Blinken said last week, if Israel doesn’t continue to sustain and make further changes, then our policy will change.  And I won’t go beyond that today.,We’re going to continue to watch.  We’ve seen positive steps.  We have welcomed those positive steps, and we have said that we need to see more steps, particularly the follow-through on the things that they have committed to publicly.,Yeah.,Q    Thank you, Jake.  Two questions, quick.  Regarding the defense industry cooperation and joint production of defense equipment between the United States and Japan, do you think South Korea and the United States and Japan will be joined in this industry cooperation as they — to strengthen their power in the Indo-Pacific region?,MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, I believe — I don’t necessarily like to use the word “synergies” very often, but I do believe that there are synergies on a trilateral basis in terms of our technological, industrial, economic capacity, as well as our security and military cooperation.  And we want to build on that.,For tomorrow, what we are announcing will be bilateral measures in this space.  And then, of course, we would be open in the future to discussing things more broadly.,Q    And one more.  Japan is approaching North Korea for a summit, but North Korea says it is not interested because there is no context for the summit.  What is the United States’ position on Japan’s push for the summit with North Korea?,MR. SULLIVAN:  I’ll — speaking from the United States’ perspective, we believe that principled diplomacy is a good thing.  It’s a necessary component of an overall strategy to confront the North Korean threat.  We ourselves have indicated we’re prepared to engage in diplomacy with North Korea.,Of course, the North Koreans have not shown any interest in that.  They have only tried to move down the track of further development of their weapons — their missile and nuclear programs.  And so, we, the United States, have pulled closer together with our allies to enhance our capacity and posture in the Indo-Pacific, and we’ll continue to do that.,Yeah.,Q    Thanks.  Jake, you were scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia before you were recently injured.  First, how are you doing?  And, second, is there a rescheduling of that meeting with the Crown Prince back on the books?,MR. SULLIVAN:  Cracking your rib is very painful.  Maybe not as — maybe not as painful as answering your questions.  (Laughter.),But I — I kind of rushed the timing on that joke, which I prepared for.  (Laughter.)  So, yeah.,No, it actually — it — it hurts a lot.  Some of you may have cracked your ribs at some point.  There’s not a lot you can do about it other than just rest.,And, yes, I intend to go to Saudi Arabia at some point soon.,Q    What happened to you?,Q    But nothing — nothing is scheduled yet?,Q    What happened, Jake?,Q    Jake, can I follow up?,Q    You’ve got to tell us, man.,Q    Just to follow up, you mentioned bilateral deliverables for the Prime Minister tomorrow.  But can you also touch on some of the more regional stuff?  There are also plans for an integrated air and defense missile system with Japan, Australia.  For example, if you can speak about that — how Japan can support AUKUS.,And also, any plans for trilateral joint naval patrols between U.S., Japan, and the Philippines.  Anything you can share?,MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first of all, on the naval patrols, we just saw trilateral, pr- — plus Australia — a new form of quadrilateral joint naval patrols last week.  So, you can expect to see more of that in the future.,With respect to AUKUS, there was an AUKUS defense ministerial yesterday with a statement that came out of it that indicated what we’ve been saying for quite some time, which is that, under Pillar 2 of AUKUS, which is the advanced technology pillar, we’re prepared to work with additional partners beyond the three of us where they can bring capabilities.,And Japan is one of the countries that could very well bring capabilities to that.  So, we will explore partnership with Japan under the — under Pillar 2 of AUKUS, as well as other partners.,Q    So, is — is — the approach, broadly, I mean, if we look at this, it’s kind of like what you guys have been trying to do in the Middle East against Iran, this joint — this integrated missile air defense system.  So, is the President’s ultimate vision, ultimately, an air and also naval network of alliances against Iran in the Middle East and then China in the Indo-Pacific?  Is that’s where he’s going?,MR. SULLIVAN:  That is not how I would characterize it.  The President has said that his alliances are not designed against, they’re designed for.  They’re designed for a free and open Indo-Pacific, for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.,And, frankly, the American alliance system has helped bring peace and stability to the Indo-Pacific for decades.  And now, we need to update and upgrade that alliance network for the modern age.  And that includes also reaching out to partners who are not traditional treaty allies of the United States, who have a key role to play in ensuring that the Indo-Pacific remains free, open, prosperous, and secure.,So, that’s how we’re looking at things across the region.,And, by the way, it goes way beyond security.  It’s economics, it’s technology, it’s infrastructure development, and it’s diplomacy.  And that’s all going to be on display in the meeting with the Prime Minister, and it’s all going to be on display in the trilateral meeting among President Marcos, Prime Minister Kishida, and President Biden.,Yeah.,Q    Just really quick on Gaza —,Q    Xi Jinping —,Q    — please, Jake, if I may.  Tomorrow is —,MR. SULLIVAN:  I think — I think —,Q    — the end of Ramadan.  The President originally said that the goal was a ceasefire before Ramadan.  Tomorrow is the end of Ramadan.  What does that say about the President’s ability to bring about peace?,MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I think it says more about the fact that you have a party, Hamas, who is holding innocent people that it took hostage a long time ago.  Doesn’t get a lot of attention, unfortunately, in the commentary, and I’ve said that from the podium before.  And there could be a ceasefire in place today that would extend for several weeks to be built upon longer if Hamas would be prepared to release some of those people.,So, let’s train the attention where it belongs, which is that the world should say at this moment to Hamas, “It’s time.  Let’s go.  Let’s get that ceasefire.”,We’re ready.  I believe Israel is ready.  And I think Hamas should step up to the table and be prepared to do so as well.,Yeah.,Q    Xi Jinping met earlier today with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.  I wondered what you made of that meeting.  And just — is the U.S. seeing any evidence that China may offer some type of direct military aid to Russia in the war with Ukraine?,MR. SULLIVAN:  We have not seen any evidence that they’ll provide direct military aid to Russia, but we have expressed our concerns about inputs to Russia’s defense industrial base — something Secretary Blinken spoke about, I think, quite effectively in Europe last week.,I can’t comment on the meeting or characterize it yet because I actually haven’t had a chance to get a readout.,Q    Jake —,MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.,Q    Jake, just to — to follow up on Danny’s question — a policy question, not a political question.  With Cameron at Mar-a-Lago, is this something that the administration knew about in advance?,And is it helpful to have the former President potentially weighing in more on Ukraine and meeting in — meeting with foreign leaders?,MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I — I’ll take the first of that as a factual question.  Yes, we knew it — about it in advance.  And beyond that, I’m not going to comment on it.,Yeah.,Q    Just wanted to follow up on the AUKUS question, because we heard a lot from the Australian Prime Minister yesterday about how it wasn’t an invitation for Japan to join that alliance.  Is that something that the U.S. envisions happening someday and is any part of this discussion this week part of moving toward that goal?,MR. SULLIVAN:  On AUKUS?,Q    On AUKUS.,MR. SULLIVAN:  Yeah.  So, what the statement said was that we’re engaging in discussions with a range of partners, and then it went on to say that Japan could be a critical contributor to this.  You will see, when they speak tomorrow, an indication that that’s th",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 direction we’re moving in.,And I’ll leave the precise terms of that announcement to the President and the Prime Minister to make so I don’t front-run them.,Yeah.,Q    Hey, Jake.  Thanks.  On the meeting with J- — Japan tomorrow, is the President going to discuss the high-speed rail in Texas?  And how does he square support for that with opposing the Nippon Steel merger or acquisition of U.S. Steel?,MR. SULLIVAN:  I can’t tell you, standing here today, whether the high-speed rail issue will come up tomorrow or not.,Yeah.,Q    One more, if I could, on BRICS.  One more, if I could, on BRICS, Jake.  Iran, Egypt, UAE, and Ethiopia have joined BRICS now, with Saudi Arabia considering it.  How worried is the President that — that he’s been degraded on the world stage in terms of — of the leadership?,MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, if you look at what’s happened with NATO, we’ve made NATO larger than ever.,If you look at what’s just happening this week: a historic trilateral with the U.S., Japan, and the Philippines.,If you look across the Indo-Pacific at how we’ve upgraded our relations not just with traditional allies, but with the likes of Vietnam, Indonesia, ASEAN as a whole.,If you look at the fact that, next month, the President will welcome the President of Kenya for a state visit here — a historic moment — one of the few times that a president has welcomed an African leader.,If you look at the fact that twice he’s hosted all of the leaders of the Pacific Islands; that he’s hosted all of the leaders of Africa at a summit in the United States; that the United States has increased its investments in the infrastructure — physical, digital, energy infrastructure — in the Americas, in Africa, and Southeast Asia and beyond; the partnership between the U.S. and India — a country in BRICS — has gone to new heights with an engagement across technology and so many ot- — and security and so many other dimensions.,I think if you look at the U.S. role and standing and its relationships across the key regions of the world, we fe- — we feel very good about where we are.,Yeah.,Q    All right.  So, Jake, really quick.  I just need an update on immigration and the funding for Haiti.  The immigration piece.  Is there going to be some kind of temporary movement to allow Haitians as they are dealing with war, the assassination of the president?  Democracy is pretty much gone.  They’re in tyranny from coordinated militia there.  Will there be a temporary change in status for immigration to the United States so they can seek asylum here instead of seeking asylum there?,And what’s going on with the funding that the White House proposed and that Republicans are kind of holding up when it comes to Haiti?,MR. SULLIVAN:  We are consulting with the Congress to try to unlock that funding, because it is critical to get a multinational security force led by the Kenyans on the ground in Haiti as soon as possible to help bring about stability and calm so that we can alleviate the suffering of innocent people in Haiti, as you were referring to.,And then the United States has a very forward-leaning policy relative to Haitians being able to access programs to come to the United States.  We will continue that as we go forward.  It’s a historic level of access for people who would be fleeing violence or otherwise seeking to deal with their circumstances in Haiti by coming here.,Q    But if — but just —,MR. SULLIVAN:  And that’s going to be our —,Q    Just to — a follow-up, though.  But if everything is so broken down in Haiti and a militia is basically controlling everything, how can people genuinely go to file for asylum and really make it happen and — and come here versus just getting on a boat or going some kind of way to get here?  I mean, it’s — wouldn’t — isn’t that harder in a war-torn or militia-torn country to do that there versus just coming here?,MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m not sure I entirely understand the question.  But the root of all of this, of people’s ability to operate freely in their country or choose where they’re going to go from there country, is security and stability.  And the United States is leading a global effort to try to help restore stability and calm to Haiti through a multinational force.,And we need the funding to do that, and I thank you for raising that, because we would like support on a bipartisan basis from the Congress to unlock that funding, which is currently being held.  And we’re pressing for that on a daily basis.,I’ll take one more question.,Yeah.,Q    Thank you, Jake.  The French Foreign Minister said that France is contemplating imposing sanctions on Israel in order to speed up humanitarian aid.  Turkey, as well, which is a close ally of yours, imposed restriction on — on trade and goods with Israel.  At what stage the administration will consider similar meas- — measures?,And, also, do you still believe that Israel is not in violation of the Geneva Convention or international humanitarian law?,MR. SULLIVAN:  So, I will say — sound a bit like a broken record to your first question, which is repeating what the President said, repeating what Secretary Blinken said: Our policy going forward is going to be determined by whether we see sustained follow-through on specific concrete and measurable steps to provide access, provide deconfliction, take other measures to alleviate the suffering of people in Gaza.,And if Israel’s policy doesn’t change on a sustained basis, in that way, our policy will change.  And I can’t go beyond that.,(Cross-talk.),Sorry — all right, fine.  One more.  Yeah, go ahead.,Q    So, back to North Korea.  If Prime Minister Kishida decided to meet Kim Jong Un, does the U.S. support of such a meeting under any concerns?,MR. SULLIVAN:  So, again, I can’t speak to a hypothetical of what may happen or may not happen.  I’ve only just made the point: On a principled, sustained basis, the United States has supported diplomacy with North Korea, as long as it fits into a broader approach that is well coordinated with us, with South Korea.  And we should continue to work in that direction.,And I can’t speak to any particular meeting, because I don’t know the specifics of it.,Thanks, guys.,(Cross-talk.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you so much, Jake.,We have about 10 minutes or so.  I think — I think some of you are tracking that the — the hostage families — or the families of the hostages are going to be speaking at the Sticks.  And we want to give you all an opportunity to ask questions — at, like, three o’clock.,Q    Did they just meet with the Vice President?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I bel- — I believe so.  Yes, they did — just met with the Vice President.  I shouldn’t say I believe so.  Yes, they just met with the — or they’re meeting — or I’m not sure where they are in that process.,So, don’t have too much time.  But, Joshua, it’s always good to see you go.  Go ahead.,Q    Good to see you.  Two quick — following up on Arizona.  Other than calling for a national law, is there anything else the administration plans to do in response?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, I think we’ve been very vocal here, right?  We’ve been very straightforward.  We’ve been — I don’t know how — how more vocal and — and leaning into where we stand on this, which is with the majority of Americans.  We believe and have been very clear — the President, the Vice President, this administration — that we have to make sure that there is a — when it comes to repr- — reproductive freedom, that it is available to — to all, to women — you know, millions of women right now who are put in a incredibly difficult situation.,We — you — you all have written about the stories.  You’ve all heard the stories about what women have to go to now because of these restrictive — extreme, restrictive bills that we have seen — laws that we have seen across the country.,So, we’re going to keep the issue of reproductive freemo — freedom at the forefront.  That’s what we’re going to do.  We’re going to continue to call it out.,It is causing chaos, what we saw this former President do in making sure that there were Supreme Court justices that he appointed to the — obviously, to the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade because of the Dobbs decision.  And, you know, it’s — it’s created some — some awful stories, some chaos, as I just mentioned.,And so, we’re going to continue to put that out at the forefront.  We believe that women’s lives are at stake across the country, and we’re just not going to stop speaking out.,And, obviously, we’re going to ask Congress to legislate and make Roe v. Wade the — the law of the land.  And that’s something that we’re going to continue to do.,Q    And th- — and then, inflation is at 3.2 percent.  It’s higher than it was in January.  Are there any concerns that the disinflation we saw last year is starting to stall out?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m going to say that this is a president that — that is doing everything that we can to fight inflation — right? — to build an economy from the bottom up, middle out.  And we’ve been pretty consistent about that.,And over — what we have seen over the past several months is that inflation is down two thirds and core inflation is at the lowest since it — since May of 2021.  That matters.,Wages are rising faster than prices over the last year.  Since the pandemic, we’ve seen 15 million jobs created because of the policies that this President has put forward — some — some really historic — bipartisan, even — legislation that’s come into law to help create those — those millions of jobs.  Unemployment is at under 4 percent.,Is there more work to be done?  Absolutely.  We’re going to continue to do everything that we can to lower — lower cost.  We’re going to take on — continue to take on Big Pharma, for example.  We’re going to continue to lower housing costs, which we know really hurts families.,And you hear talk — talk about, you know, junk fees, getting rid of junk fees and the gouging that we’re seeing from corporations.  That’s also very important.,Congress — congressional Republicans want to do the opposite.  They want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, cutting taxes for the wealthy and big corporations.  That’s not where this — the President is.  You heard him talk about it in depth during the State of the Union, and we’re going to continue to fight for Americans.,So, look, we see inflation is down.  It is important, and we’re going to continue to build an economy that leaves no one behind.,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  In Michigan, the parents of a school shooter have just been sentenced to at least 10 years in prison.  Does the White House think this precedent could impact the number of school shootings in the future?  And does the President believe parents should be held accountable in this way?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I — I — I don’t want to get ahead of the legal process here.  There is a legal process.  I want to be super careful.,But the President obviously remains committed to stopping tragedies like these from happening.  It is a tragedy that we’re seeing in all communities across the country.  Ending the epidemic of gun violence that is tearing up communities is a — is a priority for this President.,We know that, when it comes to guns, it is the number one killer of our children, and that shouldn’t be.  So, we know that most students who carry out the K to 12 school shootings are using firearms they obtained from home of a friend or a family member.  That’s why we recently announced new executive actions to help promote the safe storage of firearms.,The U.S. Department of Education released guidance to help parents and families learn about the importance of safe firearm storage.  And the DOJ released the gun guide on best practices for safely storing firearms.,Under the leadership of this President, of this administration, we’ll continue to use every tool at our disposal to implement these and other commonsense gun safety measures to protect our children.  We’re going to continue to work.  We did the Bipartisan Safer Communities Ac- — Act that you know that we passed in 2021, obviously, in a bipartisan way.  That was important.  But we need Congress to take another step.,And so, we’re going to continue to push Congress on — on taking more steps to get — get those — get those weapons of war, if you will, out of — out of — off our streets.  And that’s what the President wants to continue to do.,Q    So, no reaction?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I’m going to be super careful about the legal process.  I — I’ve talked through — I just laid out, I think in pretty detail, about what we’re doing to make sure that, you know, the stu- — as we know, the K to 12 students who carry out those types of horrific actions are getting their — easily have access to firearms.  So, we’re trying to — through DOJ, through executive action, trying to figure out and — and really help parents and — and folks really store their firearms in a way that this doesn’t happen.,So, we’ve taken actions and steps in those — in those forms, in that way.  And so, look, we’re going to continue to do what we can to work with Congress to do more.,Go ahead, Mary.,Q    Just a follow-up on Jake’s comments on Rafah.  You know, he stopped short of saying that an invasion would lead to a change in U.S. policy; you want to see how these high-level talks and conversations play out.  But the White House has been very public in warning Israel that if they don’t make concrete changes to address humanitarian suffering, there will be these changes.  Why not extend that warning to an invasion that you clearly have very deep concerns about?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I want to be really careful.  I mean, you had the National Security Advisor right in front of you lay out where we are with the conversations.  We had a virtual conversation.  Jake was part of it.  He just talked about how it — it took some hours.  That — that happened just about a week ago.,And the most important thing there is that there’s conversations happening with the Israeli government and our government.  And we’re — and they are listening to what we’re saying.  They’re — and — and obviously, we’re hearing them out.  And we understand — I want to be really clear.  We understand that there are Hamas operatives in — in the Rafah, but they’re also more than 1 million innocent civilians who are taking refuge in — in Rafah, and we want to make sure that they are protected.,So, a major military operation is not something that we support.  We’ve been pretty consistent about that.  Don’t want to get into hypotheticals here.  But we believe that the conversations are happening.  They’ve been productive.  That is important.,There’s going to be a face-to-face conversation, in-person conversation that the Israeli government agreed to.  So, that’s going to happen.,And so — but those open line of communications, as the National Security Advisor was saying just moments ago from this podium, is continuing.  They’re happening almost every day.  And so, just want to be super, super careful about not getting into hypotheticals.,But we’re in conversation.  They’ve been productive.  We had one last week virtually.  And we’re going to continue to make sure that we’re having those discussion and they hear from us directly about how we believe protecting those more than about 1.5 million civilians in Rafah — we got to protect those lives.,Go ahead.,Q    When should we expect that U.S.-Israel meeting to take place?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I believe it’s going — from what I’ve been hearing from our folks at National Security Council, it’s going to be in a couple of weeks.  But, again, those open line of communication — there’s constant communications happening every day.  But as it relates to this particular conversation, when they’re going to be here in person, members of the Israeli government, that’s going to happen in a couple of weeks.,Q    Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  A couple days ago, in Dearborn, there were protesters chanting “Death to America” and “Death to Israel.”  Does the President condemn that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yes.,Q    Is the President at all concerned that Dearborn is becoming — is facing a risk of becoming a hotbed of any sort of homegrown threats?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I don’t have any intelligence to share with you on that.  Obviously, that’s something that we’re always very vigi- — vigilant about.  But don’t have any national intelligence to — to share it with you.,Q    And then —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But obviously, we will condemn any — any violent rhetoric —,Q    Will we be seeing a statement —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — which — which we have been very — I mean, you’re hearing from me — right? — you’re asking me a question.  I’m answering it.  And we’ve been very vigi- — vigilant about — or very consistent about denouncing that type of — that type of rhetoric.,Q    Should we see a — should we expect a statement from the President on that, though?  I mean, it was a pretty significant display.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, you’re hearing from me.  I think that’s important.,The other part, too, that I do want to be very clear about: You know, peaceful protest is something that the President has also been very, very clear that is important for — to give folks space to peacefully protest.  But any type of violent rhetoric, we are going to denounce.,Q    And then, on some of the comments he made today.  Did — did the President mean to essentially accuse Republicans of — of murder?  I mean, the language that he was using to describe opposition to the Affordable Care Act — the quote was, “They want to ‘terminate’ the Affordable Care Act.  ‘Terminate.’  Well, guess what?  Killing millions of Americans…”  Does he think that Republicans are trying to kill Americans?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I — I think you’re — I think you’re taking the most extreme — extreme definition or extreme evaluation of what the President said.,Here’s the reality: The Affordable Care Act, which obviously started in the Obama-Biden administration, the President expanded on that, making sure that people have affordable healthcare.  That saves lives.  It does.,It is important —,Q    (Inaudible) use other language, though.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait, wait — it is — it is —,Q    It is stronger than usual.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But — but you’re — but you’re taking what he said to the most extreme part of — of your definition or your realization —,Q    Well, he said it.  (Laughs.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know, but — but let’s be — let’s be really clear —,Q    He’s — he’s said —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let’s —,Q    — “harm” and —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Let’s be really clear.  People having healthcare is important.  It saves lives.  It is important to have that.  The fact that this President was able to expand that is important, right?  We’re talking about people who didn’t have access to — to healthcare that could — whether they’re dealing with diabetes or cancer or something that is affecting their everyday life.  Right?,And I think, you know, when you have a party that is trying to get rid of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and says it bluntly and wants to repeal — they tried to repeal affordable healthcare — or Affordable Care Act, to be more specific, more than 60 times — they literally voted on it — when it is saving people’s lives.  Why?  Why do they do that?  Why?,Do they not want Americans to have healthcare — affordable healthcare to protect themselves, to save their lives?  I mean, that’s the question to be asked.,The President is trying to do the right thing.  He’s trying to be — be where majority of Americans are and protect — protect their healthcare, protect their Medicare, and protect their Medicaid.,And you don’t see that from the other side.  You just don’t.,He literally had a back-and-forth with them during the State of the Union about that.  So —,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you.,Q    On the nomination of a Adeel Mangi.  There are three Democrats publicly opposed.  Do you — does the administration feel like there are some winnable Republican votes here?,(Cellphone with wind chime ringtone plays.),And is the administration committed to filling this circuit court position ev- — by the end of the year, even if that means, you know, moving on from —,(Cellphone with wind chime ringtone plays.),Q    Please, turn it off.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Somebody’s door?  I don’t know what’s happening.  A chime?,Q    (Inaudible) turn it off.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Everything okay here?,Q    It’s windy.  (Laughs.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s windy.,Q    (Inaudible.),Q    Go ahead.,Q    It’s actually warm.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.)  But to your question, I’m going to be — I’m not going to comment or respond to particular members.  I will say what I’ve said many times from here, is that the President is deeply proud to have nominated an extraordinary, qualified person for this position, who is being targeted by malicious attacks.  We know that.,We — we have heard from the Anti-Defamation League.  They made that clear.  They debunked a right-wing smear campaign against Mr. Mangi.  They said it was profoundly wrong.  And it is unfortunate that we’re seeing this.,And so, we’re fighting for him.  We are continuing to have conversations with members of Congress about this.  We’re committed to getting him through.  And, you know, we — again, this President believes that he’s highly qualified and is proud to have nominated him to this position.,We have, like, one more question —,Q    Back.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — because we’re — we’re running out.,Go ahead.  Go ahead, Brian.  Go ahead, Brian.,Q    Thanks a lot, Karine.  I wanted to ask about the Mayorkas impeachment.  House Republicans are planning to send articles of impeachment to the Senate.  What is the President’s response to this?  And has the President personally reached out to members of the Senate to talk about this?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, the President spoke — I think, the last time they tried to do this and were unsuccessful, the President put out a statement, and he said that the history will not look kindly on House Republicans about this.,It is a blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship.  That’s what the President has said, and he continues to believe that.,Look, the President was in Madison, Wisconsin, yesterday.  He talked about student loans.  He talked about ways to give Americans a little bit more breathing room, making sure that they can go after their dreams — right? — making sure that borrowers who have been really crunched by — by student loans has an opportunity to get out from that.,And that’s something that Republicans could be helpful with.  But, instead, they get in the way and s- — they get in the way and block what the President is doing.  But he’s going to continue to do that.,There is a national security supplemental that could go to the floor in the — in Hou- — in the House, that the Speaker can put to the floor.  We know it would pass overwhelmingly.  We know that it would protect our national security.  It would help Ukraine — the brave people Ukraine, who are fighting for their democracy — help them.  They are getting in the way of that.,So, look, there — there are ways.  Let’s not forget the bipartisan border deal — right? — that the former President said to Republicans to reject that deal because it wi- — it would help Joe Biden and hurt him.,Who — who are they working for?  Are they actually working for the constituents who put them into office?  I mean, that’s a question for them to — to have to answer.,Majority of Americans — the things that I just listed out, majority of Americans want to see action.  They want to see us work in a bipartisan way.  We saw that coming out of the 2022 midterm election.  They want to see us come together and get things done.,So, House Republicans need to stop playing politics.  They need to stop being partisan about these issues that matter to majority of Americans and get to work — and get to work.  We expect them to be leaders, but so do Americans expect them to be leaders as well.,Guys, I have to go, because I know they’re going to go to the sticks.  And I want to make sure that you guys get that.,Q    Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And so, the President, obviously, is going to have the two-plus-two press conference tomorrow, and then we’ll be back on Thursday.,Thanks, everybody.,Q    Thanks, Karine.,Q    Thank you.,3:03 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,State-by-state analysis shows how the Republican Study Committee budget would gut job training and workforce development programs that strengthen our economy and create pathways to good jobs,President Biden is building our economy from the middle out and bottom up—an economy where we invest in all Americans to make sure the middle class has a fair shot and no one gets left behind. That includes ensuring that every American—whether they go to college or not—has equitable access to high-quality training, education, and services that provide a path to a good career without leaving their community. This approach is working, with 15 million jobs created and the unemployment rate under 4% for the longest stretch in half a century.,House Republicans have a very different economic vision. The Republican Study Committee (RSC)—which speaks for 80% of House Republicans and 100% of their leadership—recently released an extreme budget proposal that would throw workers under the bus while doing the bidding of big corporations and the super wealthy. The budget would cut critical investments in families and communities by over 30 percent—including slashing funding for key job training and employment services programs.,These cuts would cause hundreds of thousands of workers and job seekers to lose access to vocational training and individualized career services that create pathways to in-demand, high-quality jobs—undermining efforts to build a skilled workforce that businesses need to thrive. In addition to these reckless cuts, the RSC budget would further undermine workers by eliminating the National Labor Relations Board and making deep cuts to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.,House Republicans want to deny workers access to critical job training and employment services at the same time that they are fighting for another $5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. They want to cut taxes for big corporations and the wealthy, make it easier for them to cheat on their taxes, and preserve policies that encourage corporations to move jobs and profits offshore—all while undermining American workers.,President Biden has a different approach: one that makes billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share, while investing in American workers and the middle class—the real backbone of our economy.,Under the RSC budget, more than 900,000 people in states and territories across the country would be denied access to job training and employment services provided through the Department of Labor:,This analysis assumes an across-the-board reduction of roughly 31% compared to the currently enacted FY 2024 levels for non-defense discretionary (NDD) accounts. This aligns with the Republican Study Committee Budget, which would cut NDD base funding to $534 billion in FY 2025, a roughly 31% reduction from the funding provided in the enacted FY 2024 bills.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",09-04-24,FACT SHEET: Extreme House Republican Plan Would Hurt American Workers While Rigging the Economy for Big Corporations and the Wealthy,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/09/fact-sheet-extreme-house-republican-plan-would-hurt-american-workers-while-rigging-the-economy-for-big-corporations-and-the-wealthy/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDT,MODERATOR: Thank you. And hi, everyone. Thank you again for joining today’s background call to preview the official visit of Prime Minister Kishida of Japan.,Today’s call is on background. Speakers on today’s call will be attributed as senior administration officials.,On today’s call we have [senior administration official], [senior administration official], and [senior administration official]. Again, today’s call is on background, attributed to senior administration officials. And the call will be held under embargo until tomorrow at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.,By participating in today’s call, you are agreeing to these ground rules.,I will now turn the call over to [senior administration official].,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. And thank you all very much for joining us today. It’s really a pleasure and honor to be with you all.,Let me, if I can, first place this visit in a larger context. I think it is undeniable that at the conclusion of this visit we will judge it to be a remarkable and historic summit. And it’s long in the making. We’ve been working on this kind of summit and state visit, frankly, for years. Our two leaders have met over a dozen times in a number of capacities. Prime Minister Kishida graciously hosted President Biden for an official visit as part of the G7 engagements in Hiroshima. And they’ve met on a number of occasions, engaging on the most critical issues before us.,I will say that what we’ve seen specifically is what was largely a regional alliance, and important alliance undeniably, but now a global partnership that I think could be judged as if not our most important global alliance, then among the most important. And I think that reality will be on full display over the course of the next few days.,I do want to just take a moment, if I may, just to commend. These summits are enormously challenging endeavors. Lots of spinning plates and engagements with huge stakes at every turn. And I just want to commend the two people that I’m on the call with today. [Senior administration official] has been the spearhead of this effort, driving forward on what we call deliverables. And I would just underscore that that list is over 70; it’s not uncommon to occasionally have a dozen, maybe 20, at the outside. This is probably the largest set of substantial, significant deliverables that we’ve seen of its kind. And [senior administration official] and her team have helped drive that forward.,I will also say my friend and colleague [senior administration official] has basically set a new standard for what it means to be an activist, determined, a passionate advocate for a relationship between two countries. And what he’s done in the U.S.-Japan context is no short of remarkable.,Now, I will say Prime Minister Kishida arrived with his team, members of governments from the Diet and the business community, yesterday. It’s an appropriate time of year as we celebrate the Cherry Blossom Festival starting this weekend.,We will have a number of engagements. [Senior administration officials] will run through them. But I think what you will see is a huge number of deliverables in the security arena, but I do want to underscore that the progress and future-oriented stance of our alliance that is on display in Haiti, in the Ukraine, in Southeast Asia, in the Pacific — everywhere that American purpose is being put to the test, Japan is by our side. You will see that clearly animated in our deliverables.,We are working to build stronger bonds in technology, in joint investment running each way, programming that advances our joint interests in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, and clear initiatives with respect to people-to-people.,I think, in many respects, this relationship and what you will see is the fundamental validation of President Biden’s Indo-Pacific strategy, which seeks to elevate the role of partners and allies in concert with us as we seek to keep an open, secure, and vital Indo-Pacific.,I do just want to underscore just a couple of things as we go forward. The initiatives are both sophisticated and down to earth.,I do want to just mention one particular thing. I think the two most important gifts that countries have given the United States over the course of our existence: one would be the Statue of Liberty, and the second might be the gift, 110 years ago from Japan, of the cherry trees around the Tidal Basin.,This is a tribute to both [senior administration official] and others on the Japanese side. I think they noted a few weeks ago that, sadly, several hundred of those trees would have to be felled in order to do some work around the Tidal Basin. The Japanese immediately understood the significance of that; offered us to help provide saplings when the time is right to replace these felled trees, to signal their continuing friendship and partnership.,I think we’ll find that it’s initiatives like this that may not be as significant as apparently as new arrangements on military command structures or joint co-production on the military side, but they’re deeply significant to our peoples. And we are grateful. Prime Minister Kishida will have a planting ceremony tomorrow on the Mall to basically underscore his commitment to this.,I’d like to turn it over now to [senior administration official] to basically give us a blow by blow about how we arrived here, what he thinks are the big moving pieces that are significant, both in the Indo-Pacific and globally, as we take the U.S.-Japan relationship to the next level. Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, [senior administration official]. I want to emphasize and underscore something [senior administration official] said, because in the last 60 years, you would define this relationship between the United States and Japan, since it got formalized in 1960, as one of alliance protection. I think this state visit kind of ends that era and defines the next period of time, this alliance projection from alliance protection.,And in the last two years that allowed this transition to occur, the Prime Minister changed five to six major 70-year-old policies that have always been on the books. Japan has gone from a 1 percent cap on defense spending to 2 percent of GDP. And that was before there was even a tank on the Ukrainian border. And it’s going to become the third-largest military spender in the world.,They’ve acquired Tomahawk counter-strike capability, which will have a real effectiveness to the credibility of our collective deterrence.,Third, they’ve lifted the cap on defense technology export.,Fourth, with us they have raised the ROK-Japan-U.S. relationship, as experienced in Camp David, to a level of stability that shifted the strategic landscape in the Indo-Pacific as one of (inaudible) main pillars has been that the ROK, Japan, and the United States (inaudible), all three get on the same page.,Fifth is, the day that Russia invaded Ukraine, they ended their policy with Russia and decided to throw all their weight behind values and ideals of (inaudible) democratic democracies and understand that Russia had to be sanctioned because this cannot be permissible behavior, become a norm. The raw exercise of power was committed and accepted and became the new norm.,In that same time, I think then what has that committed for the United States? One is: For the first time ever, we’re going to change the force structure that we have in Japan so it actually can make the most of their new joint operations center that’s part of the defense budget and have a real capacity and capability to integrate our forces. Second is: Now with the cap on the defense export being lifted, we’re going to have a military industrial council that will evaluate where we can (inaudible) and co-produce defense weapons. And so, Japan’s industrial capacity and strength that had always been on the sidelines will come to bear on one of the weak points right now that we have, which is we don’t have really the bandwidth on the defense production capacity that we need for our strategic applications.,There will also be pieces as related to the integrated missile defense system with Australia, the United States, and Japan.,The second column, which is — in the last two years, we’ve signed five separate space agreements with Japan: Artemis, Gateway, Mars, International Space Station framework, and there’ll be a major agreement to the lunar exploration with Japan as a full partner, from expending major resources with their NASA equivalent, which is JAXA.,And then building on the people-to-people, two initiatives. There’ll be a joint AI research between Carnegie Mellon and Keio University, their major private university in Tokyo. That will be in the AI area, funded by both a series of Japanese companies and Microsoft. And then AI — a separate but a different part of AI — between the University of Washington in Washington State and Tsukuba University. And that’s going to be with Amazon and NVIDIA at $50 million.,And then a third kind of people-to-people, which is Norman Mineta scholarship, $12 million, to fund students in their junior year of high school to go live overseas and study — the United States students go to Japan, and Japan high school students come to the United States. The Norm Mineta scholarship.,But to me, each of these, in the end of the day, are — all the particulars add up to a major shift where Japan, which used to be, you know, only worried about the perimeters of their island, projecting not only into the region and the alliance and its value system, but being a full global partner on whatever happens in Europe, the Mideast, and also the Indo-Pacific.,And so, this state visit comes at a point that the relationship is shifting to a higher and different level, and having the building blocks and the deliverables that underscore each one of those pieces.,[Senior administration official]?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, [senior administration official].,[Senior administration officials] put out a lot on the table here, so I’ll just a saw a few words to wrap up our topper, and then I look forward to taking your questions.,There’s certainly a lot more we can dig into in our defense and security deliverables, where there’s some really (inaudible) advances taking place within the U.S.-Japan alliance, some of which are some of the most consequential moves we will have taken in decades.,But as [senior administration official] just indicated, what we’re really doing here is culminating three years of fast and furious work that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago and, frankly, unimaginable with a leader other than Fumio Kishida, but that has truly taken this alliance to the next level, modernized it, and now put us on a pathway to even bigger things.,And we’ll be taking our next logical steps tomorrow and also lighting the pathway for U.S.-Japan alliance managers for many years to come.,But a broader point that I think I’ll leave it with and conclude these opening remarks is the fact that the President’s visit with Prime Minister Kishida tomorrow, as well as the trilat that he’ll be holding with Prime Minister Kishida and President Marcos of the Philippines later this week, is both a really important and consequential set of meetings in and of themselves, but it’s also a proving ground for the President’s theory of case when it comes to his entire Indo-Pacific strategy.,When the President took office over three years ago, his theory of the case was that if the United States reinvested in its alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific and built collective capacity as we put it in our Indo-Pacific strategy, along with others, that those allies and partners would step up alongside in ways that made us much better able, much better equipped to accomplish our objectives in this critical region.,And nowhere is this theory better proven out than in our alliance with Japan, where Prime Minister Kishida has stepped up and stepped out into the world more than anyone really ever could have imagined.,So that’s what you’ll see on display tomorrow. We have a lot to celebrate, and we’re excited for the pathway ahead. I’ll stop there.,MODERATOR: Great. Thank you all for opening remarks. Moderator, I think we are ready to move into the Q&A portion.,OPERATOR: Moving to our first caller. Michael Shear, your line is unmuted. Please go ahead.,Q Hey all. Thanks for doing the call. I appreciate it. Two quick questions.,One, can you describe what, if any, message President Trump [sic] is going to deliver to the Prime Minister about U.S. Steel and his concerns about a potential acquisition?,And two, to what extent are you all — do you all feel an urgency to cement, I think as [senior administration official] called it, this next level of relationship, given the coming election and the fears in — you know, sort of abroad in many places, but maybe in Japan too, about the possibility that President Trump could come back into office and all that could mean to the region and to the alliance?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I’ll start maybe, and then let — I think you inadvertently said what would President Trump have to say. I think you probably meant —,Q Oh, sorry. President Biden. Sorry.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Probably inadvertently reveals your state of mind as well, though.,So, look, on the second part of that question, I can say this: Look, I think we all recognize that there is anxiety in capitals, uncertainty about what the nature of the future of U.S. policy will look like, whether we will remain as engaged in internationalist pursuits and the kinds of bipartisan foreign policy efforts which have animated the last period, both after the Second World War and after the Cold War. There are questions and concerns there.,I think what we believe, and the people on this call have been deeply engaged with this, is that by strengthening and validating the concept of load-bearing bilateral and multilateral relationships — countries that are prepared to lend a hand and work with us and, in some cases, leading efforts — we think that validates that philosophy and creates a kind of momentum of its own.,And so, I think it would be fair to say that, you know, there are a number of responses internationally. I think some countries have sought to lie low. Others recognize that the best approach is to double down and engage deeply with the United States. And we’re seeking to do that.,And I think the Japan experience and what we’ve seen with Prime Minister Kishida is a case study in recognizing that their best possible way forward is a deep, substantial, continuing engagement with the United States.,[Senior administration official]?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I’ll pass to [senior administration official] actually on this one.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Mike, let me just deal with the second question, and then I’ll go to the first.,On the second question: Look, there is a tactic and a strategic objective by China, which is to isolate the Philippines, what they’re doing on the coast guard, or to isolate Japan, what they’re doing with the embargo on fish.,The idea of switching to a multilateral lattice-like strategic architecture is then to flip the script and isolate China. When you have, like we did this week, the United States, Japan, Australia, and the Philippines doing an exercise together, when you have the trilat on Thursday, the country that’s isolated is China, not the Philippines.,And in every practice that we’re doing — the strategic, diplomatic, military exercises of doing it multinational is that the end result is that China’s attempt to intimidate one country, make an example of that country and intimidate the others in the neighborhood, flips the script and China is the isolated and the outlier in the neighborhood (inaudible). So that’s number one.,And number two is: You know, I’ve seen it upfront with now three presidents. Not only the trilateral on Thursday, but the one at Camp David with the ROK — if they have trust in America and then personal trust in President Biden, or (inaudible) president, other leaders are going to go past just clearing the bar. They’re going to stretch themselves, spend political capital because it means something and comes back to value.,So the real answer is: Some of this is standalone and will stand the test of time. Building on it requires somebody that’s invested in it. So there’s also risk that’s straight up, because people are putting resources — the Australians, South Korea — ROK, Japan, the Philippines — in the United States because they trust us, they want to work with us, and they know that we are the right kind of counterweight to an untethered China.,Then to the first question on Nippon Steel: Look, the relationship between the United States and Japan is far bigger and more significant than a single commercial deal.,Six weeks ago, the United States gave Mitsui, a Japanese company, a $20 billion deal to build a crane factory here in the United States and replace all our port cranes throughout the United States. Nothing says trusted ally like a $20 billion contract with a Japanese company.,And in 2021, outside companies or foreign companies were looking at Toshiba. Japan said, on national security interests, they didn’t want that to go forward.,So I guess would just basically understand — everybody understands where we are. Everybody understands the significance of not only this visit but also the relationship. And it’s larger than a single effort. And I say that as somebody who started his political career back in — national political career in 1992 working for Bill Clinton.,We’re in a different place fundamentally. And I just think that this single commercial transaction does not define not only the visit, but the relationship and its potential and what is actually delivering in the region or across the globe. And both leaders (inaudible).,OPERATOR: Moving to the next caller in the queue.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And for the record, I was talking about President Biden, not President Trump.,OPERATOR: Moving to the next caller. Demetri Sevastopulo from Financial Times. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead.,Q Thanks. I have two questions. The first is for [senior administration official]. The other day at CNAS, you said Japan had made some progress implementing information security systems improvements. How far do you think they are from getting to a place where the U.S. and the Five Eyes are kind of comfortable with their level of security?,And then, for any of you, what sort of the things that you’re doing right now with Japan, including restructuring the U.S. command in Japan, are complete? Do you think we’re at a point where Japan could actually fight alongside the U.S. if there was a contingency over Taiwan? Or is that still a long way away?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I’ll start and then [senior administration officials] jump in.,So, look, I think it’s fair to say that our Japanese partners and allies have taken substantial steps on information security and procedures that protect the most sensitive of information potentially shared between United States and Japan.,As I indicated, there is still more work to do. I think we believe that there are legislative steps, as well as executive actions, that are possible.,You will see over the course of the next few days that we are stepping up our intelligence cooperation. This is an area that [senior administration official] has played a key role in, in particularly ensuring on key initiatives that the two countries are in sync and in close coordination on key information. And I think some of those steps have been deeply successful. And we’re seeking to build on those as we go forward.,I think what you will see over the course of the next couple of days are major steps on the security side, highlighting some cyber-related efforts and also our fundamental goal of being able to share the most important information with our closest ally, Japan.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, [senior administration official]. You know, the only thing I’ll had on the Taiwan bit is that the U.S. and Japan have carefully honed public (inaudible) on Taiwan that we worked through together a few years ago. And we expect you’ll see language that’s quite similar on this visit.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I got nothing to add.,OPERATOR: Moving to the next caller in queue. Ken Moriyasu from Nikkei Asia. Please go ahead. Your line is unmuted.,Q Hello, thank you very much. I think [senior administration official] said that Japan, until now, was only worried about the parameters of the island but now they will be a full global partner on whatever happens in Europe. This seems like a very drastic statement. What is your expectation of the engagement in places like Ukraine and Gaza? Will it be just political support, or do you expect some kind of security cooperation as well? Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Ken, you’ve been following this, so it’s not a surprise. Day one they’ve been a full partner on the sanctions. There hasn’t been any equivocation there. They’ve called — their efforts as chair of the G7 has been, as it relates to Ukraine, been incredible in the sense they’re, step by step, measuring all the sanctions, as recently as including Arctic 2.,The second piece of that is there’s no greater contributor to the energy infrastructure that’s being targeted by Putin than Japan, with Mitsubishi and (inaudible) Kawasaki building the major transformers there. I think it’s close to six or — (inaudible) on the exact dollars, but I think it’s close to $6- or $7 billion.,They have used their position and assistance. They just re-upped funding as it relates to food relief in Gaza.,So they are a global partner. And what I meant, and I stand by, is the last period of time has all been just about the defense of Japan. They are stepping beyond that role into — and they did it in March 2022 when there was a U.N. resolution condemning Russia’s vote. They not only voted the correct way; they helped corral 8 out of the 10 ASEAN countries to all vote in favor of condemning Russia for the (inaudible), co-sponsors of the resolution. And that was Japan’s initiative. So, yeah, a global partner.,OPERATOR: Moving to the next caller. (Inaudible) with Kyoto News. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead.,Q Hi, thank you for taking my question. I would like to ask for AUKUS pillar two, which is likely to be one of the topics at the meeting tomorrow. Is there any specific area in which Japan could bring significant contribution to enforce AUKUS pillar two? Is it AI hypersonic capability or other (inaudible)? Would you give us some explanation? Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I’m happy to take this one.,You know, we think that Japan stands to potentially bring a great deal to AUKUS pillar two. And as you’re tracking, we will be noting tomorrow that the AUKUS partners are excited to begin their consultations with Japan towards possible inclusion in pillar two.,But I do want to note, number one, that Japan is one of several additional partners that the AUKUS partners are closely considering partnering with under this pillar two (inaudible). And number two, that we expect the consultations will take a period of months, and it will take a portion of the 2024 calendar year before the AUKUS two pillar — the AUKUS pillar two vision is fully fleshed out, that is with us being able to assign specific partners to specific pillar two projects.,So there’s no doubt that Japan brings a great deal to the table. That’s why we are announcing that AUKUS partners want to begin consultations with Tokyo as soon as possible. But we have a way to go before we’re able to share some of the details that you just raised.,OPERATOR: Moving to the next caller. Jennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg News. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead.,Q Hey, thanks. I heard your answer to the New York Times question about Nippon Steel. So you guys are saying that you do think that the topic of the steel deal will come up between the President and the Prime Minister?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No.,Q Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: (Inaudible) to predict, but no, we don’t, because I think that the relationship is much bigger, and I think that everybody understands everybody’s position. I was trying to give you reference points for both Mitsui and Toshiba as kind of — as to kind of appreciate where this is.,OPERATOR: Moving to the next caller. Ryo Kiyomiya from the Asahi Shimbun. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead.,Q Thank you so much for this opportunity. My question is about the change of the (inaudible) in Japan. First, could you please clear us on expected timeline of deciding and establishing new U.S. force structure in Japan? And also, do expect a drastic change of posture in Japan, such as increasing the number of U.S. personnel of the U.S. (inaudible) or sending of (inaudible) to Japan?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I’m happy to take this one as well.,We’ll be announcing tomorrow our commitment to modernizing our alliance partner posture, including our command and control, in Japan. But I do expect it will take a period of months for the details of those changes to be worked through.,Of course, we’re doing this in close partnership with the government of Japan, with the aim of making ourselves a very neat fit for the new joint operations command that Japanese friends are standing (inaudible). Secretary of Defense Austin and our new INDOPACOM commander will work through the details of what exactly that modernized approach is going to look like.,But tomorrow, not only will the leaders commit to this — undertaking this project together, a project which, as [senior administration official] highlighted, is in many ways one of the biggest changes to take place in the U.S.-Japan alliance since 1960, but they will direct our two-plus-two ministerial structure to take on the responsibility of executing these changes (inaudible).,So this is all to say: Stay tuned. It’ll take a period of months to work through. But we have not only a commitment but the structure to get these details hashed out very soon.,OPERATOR: Moving to the next caller. Prashant Jha from Hindustan Times. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead.,Q Hi. My question is for [senior administration official]. One of the things that you said was this is a validation of the Indo-Pacific strategy of the President, where he assigns this role to partners, and partners step up. I was wondering how you’re thinking of India within the context of this deepening military, defense, security partnership with your treaty allies in East Asia. Do you see India as a part of this network? We know that, bilaterally, India’s relations have improved with the U.S. as well as with these countries. Do you see it as a part of a wider network as well? Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: First of all, thank you very much for the question. I do — and I understand the way you asked it, but I think it’s important to just underscore: I don’t think this is about the United States assigning roles to countries. I think it is much more about working in partnership with likeminded and other states who share common views about what should be upheld on the global stage with respect to key features of the global operating system that I think we’ve all benefited from.,I think if you ask the President, one of the things that he’s proudest of is his efforts to build a stronger relationship between the United States and India. And I do believe, both in the Indo-Pacific and the Indian Ocean, and on key issues like technology, the United States and India are working more closely together than ever before.,And I would simply say that I think the U.S.-India relationship is trending substantially in a positive direction and that our level of engagement across every possible vector — security, intelligence, technology, people-to-people — has excelled.,And I think the point that [senior administration official] made is not only have our relations with India improved in a bilateral context, but it is also the case that India’s partnership with other countries, working with us and then working just independently, has also stepped up substantially. I would say, in many respects, engagement with India is some of the most — the most desired kinds of engagements on the global stage, and we’ve seen this with a variety of key players.,I’ll be in India next week to celebrate elements of our bilateral relationship, compare notes on the Indo-Pacific, and also talk about next steps in technology cooperation. We think these are all effective, prudent elements of taking the U.S.-India relationship to the next level.,And, yes, I do believe, perhaps in the past, on both sides, there perhaps had been some ambivalence or some uncertainty. I see very little of that now. I see leaders on both sides who are all in on the promise and prospects of the other, recognize the potential of this relationship that is deeply supported by an activist diaspora community here, and technology and other firms who understand the potential of India.,And I would just simply say that I see the engagement with India as central to everything that we’re seeking to do on the global stage. And I would simply say that I think, in many respects, it will be our most important bilateral partnership heading into the latter parts of the 21st century.,So, thank you for that.,OPERATOR: Moving to our next caller. Sang-ho Song from Yonhap News Agency. Your line is unmuted. Please go ahead.,Q Thank you for doing this. I have a question for [senior administration official]. You talked about the transition from alliance protection to alliance projection. So can you elaborate further on what you actually meant by projection? Is it projection of power for global security?,And my second question is that: What kind of end state are you pursuing when it comes to the combined command structure? Are the United States and Japan pursuing these structures akin to the Combined Forces Command in South Korea between the U.S. Forces Korea and the (inaudible) military? Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, let me say about alliance projection: A lot of times, as you just did, it’s always defined as — or kind of narrowed down to defense. I actually see — if one of the things we want is credible deterrence, we should widen the definition of what deterrence looks like.,And I think both the trilateral meeting with the Philippine president, the trilateral meeting and gathering that happened at Camp David, that’s about credible deterrence. As much as what Japan is doing individually and then in collaboration with us on a series of exercises, it’s about the credibility of deterrence. What they’re negotiating with the Philippines, the reciprocal agreement, that’s part of deterrence.,So the wider definition is, in my view, what matters here. And when I say about alliance projection in the region — when it’s either the Quad or either one of the trilats, or whether it’s a military exercise with the Philippines, the constant in all this by our side is Japan. That did not exist 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. It’s a different — this is the new norm. And the constant in both the diplomatic arena, the defense arena, or the development and economic arena, which will be a big part of what happens with the Philippines trilat, is Japan is the constant in this effort.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would just add one other thing to [senior administration official] colleagues that — look, it should not be lost on you that this is our fifth state visit and state dinner. But four of the five — this is the crowning partnership of the Quad. And so, this suggests how the President views the Quad, how important it is, how central it has been to his vision of a deeper Indo-Pacific engagement. And at the heart of that, as [senior administration official] has indicated, is Japan. Everything that we’re doing of purpose on the global stage we’re doing with Japan.,Q Could I ask also about the command stru",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ture, the end state of this?,MODERATOR: Unfortunately, we have to conclude today’s call. I’d like to offer it up to [senior administration official] for any quick closing remarks here.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I’ll just speak briefly to that last question, which is to say, you know, the end state is that close integration and coordination of our forces, of the U.S. and Japan, in a way that’s appropriate for 21st century challenges. I think both of our countries has been clear that that’s the objective of our alliance modernization efforts. And we look forward to pursuing it in lockstep.,But zooming out, just back to sort of (inaudible) context of the week we’re having here, obviously we’ve been talking about, in a fair amount of detail, a number of these really substantial deliverables that are going to move our alliance forward in consequential ways.,But I want to bring us back to the fact that in addition to this state visit with Prime Minister Kishida — which, of course, in celebration of how much we’ve achieved in the last three years — we are also holding the first-ever trilateral leaders’ summit with President Marcos on Thursday. We’ll be back to share more on that tomorrow and to preview some of the outcomes then.,But when you take these two achievements together, these are critical parts of a much bigger picture in which the President’s vision, Jake Sullivan’s vision for how we do strategy in the Indo-Pacific is bearing itself out in real time.,You’re seeing a single treaty ally, who has always been one of the United States’ closest partners, stepping up in more consequential ways than anyone could have imagined. And another ally in the Philippines working more closely with us than (inaudible) the years. And the three of us together able to marshal resources towards common objectives in ways that weren’t even on the horizon two years ago.,So it really is an important week for (inaudible) in addition to our bilateral visit and the deliverables that we’re unveiling tomorrow. We’re grateful to all of you for the conversation today. And we look forward to talking about more soon.,MODERATOR: All right, thank you so much. And thank you all for joining today. Thank you to [senior administration official]. Thank you to [senior administration official].,I’d just like to remind everyone that this call is on background, attributed to senior administration officials, embargoed for tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m.,I also wanted to flag for everyone that we will hold, for everyone’s planning purposes, another background call tomorrow afternoon, I believe at 3:00 p.m., to preview the trilateral summit of the U.S., Japan, and the Philippines. So, stay tuned for information about that.,And if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to myself or our team here at the NSC. Thank you very much.,6:22 P.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington," DC 20500""",10-04-24,Background Press Call Previewing the Official Visit of Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/04/10/background-press-call-previewing-the-official-visit-of-prime-minister-kishida-fumio-of-japan/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,During,Care Workers Recognition Month,, the Biden-Harris Administration is marking the progress we have made to make care more affordable for American families, support family caregivers, boost compensation and job quality for care workers, and expand care options. Today, President Biden will be joined by care workers and unions as he lays out how he will build on that progress with transformational investments in child care, home care, paid family and medical leave, tax cuts for workers and families, and other priorities, which are fully paid for by making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share in taxes. That is in sharp contrast with congressional Republicans, who would make devastating cuts to funding for care, healthcare, Social Security, and Medicare to pay for massive tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.,The Need to Improve Care,Too many families and individuals struggle to access the affordable, high-quality care they need. The cost of child care is up 26% in the last decade and more than 200% over the past 30 years. For older adults and people with disabilities, long-term care costs are up 40% over the past decade. As a result, the cost of care is out of reach for many Americans. At the same time, care workers—who are disproportionately women of color—struggle to make ends meet, even as they care for others. Due to the low pay and the demanding nature of care work, turnover rates are high. In addition, at least 53 million Americans serve as family caregivers—including over 5 million caring for service members or veterans—and many face challenges due to the lack of support, training, and respite.,The President’s Plan to Lower Costs for Families for Care,The President has made child care, long-term care, family caregiving, and paid leave a core part of his domestic and economic agendas. He has referenced these issues in each of his State of the Union Addresses, and proposed transformative investments in each budget. The President’s most recent budget proposes the following:,Affordable, High-Quality Child Care and Universal Preschool,High-quality early childhood education improves the lives of both children and their parents. The President’s child care plan provides a lifeline to the parents of more than 16 million children by guaranteeing affordable, high-quality child care from birth until kindergarten for low- and middle-income working families. Right now, the average price of child care is nearly $11,000 a year, with low-income families paying as much as a third of their income for child care. Under the President’s plan, most families would pay $10 per day, saving the average family over $600 per child, per month. The budget also invests in free, voluntary, universal preschool for all of the nation’s 4-year-olds and charts a path to expand preschool to 3-year-olds. Together, these investments will make early care and education programs affordable and available where families live and work in communities across the country, increase wages for early childhood education workers, and strengthen the economy.,Child Tax Credit,The President’s Budget would restore the expanded Child Tax Credit, lifting 3 million children out of poverty and cutting taxes by an average of $2,600 for 39 million low- and middle-income families that include 66 million children. This includes 18 million children in low-income families who would be newly eligible for the full credit, and 2 million children living with a caregiver who is at least 60 years old. It would also provide breathing room for day-to-day expenses by allowing families to receive their tax credit through monthly payments.,Long-term Care and Family Caregiving,The President is committed to protecting older adults’ and people with disabilities’ health and dignity. His plan would invest in expanding Medicaid home and community-based services to help a larger number of older adults and people with disabilities receive care in their home or community, and promote better opportunities for home care workers and family caregivers. There has been substantial growth amongst the younger population under 65 with disabilities living in nursing homes. The percentage of individuals younger than 65 living in residential nursing facilities grew from 10.6 in 2000 to 16.2 in 2017. The President’s investments will help ensure that they can receive care in their own homes and communities. The President has also proposed substantial investments for family caregivers serving our nation’s heroes, including stipends and support services for family caregivers of eligible veterans.,A National Paid Family and Medical Leave Program,Many workers with caregiving responsibilities are forced to leave the workforce intermittently or permanently to take care of their loved ones. As of March 2022, only 24% of private sector workers in the United States had access to paid family leave through their employer and only 43% had access to short-term disability insurance through their employer. The President proposes a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program, administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to ensure that all workers can take time off to care for and bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one’s military deployment; or find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or grieve the death of a loved one.  The vast majority of America’s workers do not have access to employer-provided paid family leave, including 73 percent of private sector workers. Among the lowest-paid workers, who are disproportionately women and workers of color, 94 percent lack access to paid family leave through their employers. Some people’s caregiving responsibilities are so demanding that under the current system they have to give up paid work entirely or retire early to take care of their loved ones.,The Biden-Harris Administration’s Historic Actions on Care,Since day one of the Administration, President Biden and Vice President Harris have been committed to improving the quality of and access to care while supporting care workers and family caregivers. The President’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) provided an historic $39 billion in child care relief funds to provide relief for child care providers and support for families to afford care. The ARP delivered $37 billion across all 50 states for activities and investments that enhance, expand, and strengthen home and community-based services and $145 million to help the National Family Caregiver Support Program deliver counseling, training, and short-term relief to family and other informal care providers. Moreover, over the past three years, the President has secured close to a 50% increase in federal child care assistance and a $1.5 billion increase in funding for Head Start. And in April 2023, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers (Care EO) surrounded by people with disabilities, family caregivers, long-term care workers, early educators, veterans, and aging advocates. The EO was celebrated by leaders from across the country. Over the past year, agencies have made substantial progress implementing the Care EO. For example:,In addition to these actions, federal agencies have taken dozens of others over the past year to improve family caregiving, long-term care, and child care. A full list can be found,here,.,Republican Officials Want to Provide Massive Taxes Cuts to the Rich while Making Devastating Cuts to Programs Working Families Count On,President Biden is building our economy from the middle out and bottom up—an economy where we invest in all Americans to make sure the middle class has a fair shot and no one gets left behind.,House Republicans have a very different economic vision. Under the RSC budget, care would be on the cutting block. Their budget proposal translates to 264,600 fewer child care slots and 253,500 fewer high-quality Head Start slots. These investments are critical to giving children a strong start and making sure that families have the help they need to thrive.,Along with damaging cuts to care funding, House Republicans would slash Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and other supports that working families count on. House Republicans would make these devastating cuts to pay for another $5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. Their budget would deliver windfall tax cuts to billionaires and their heirs, eliminate the minimum tax on billion-dollar corporations President Biden signed into law, make it easier for the wealthy and corporations to cheat on their taxes, and preserve policies that encourage corporations to move jobs and profits offshore—all while making it more difficult for families to afford child care and education.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",09-04-24,FACT SHEET: Biden-⁠Harris Administration Highlights Substantial Progress on the President’s Care Agenda During Month of Action on Care,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/09/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-substantial-progress-on-the-presidents-care-agenda-during-month-of-action-on-care/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,EPA Announces First-Ever National Standard to Address PFAS in Drinking Water, Delivers an Additional $1 Billion through President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda to Combat PFAS Pollution,President Biden believes every community has the right to clean, safe drinking water, free of pollutants that harm people’s health and wellbeing. That is why the President,launched a comprehensive action plan,and provided billions in funding to protect communities from toxic “forever chemicals” that are linked to a range of severe health problems, including cancers, liver and heart damage, and developmental impacts in children. Found in drinking water, soil, air, and our food supply, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) persist in the environment for long periods of time, posing a serious health threat across rural, suburban, and urban areas.,Today the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is,announcing the first-ever national legally enforceable drinking water standard for PFAS,,,which will,protect 100 million people from PFAS exposure,,,prevent tens of thousands of serious illnesses, and save lives.,This action complements the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to combatting PFAS pollution and delivering clean water.,President Biden has secured historic levels of funding to meet this new standard.,Today,,the Biden-Harris Administration is also announcing an additional $1 billion through President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to help every state and territory fund PFAS detection and treatment systems to meet the new standard,. This funding is part of the $9 billion in dedicated funding through the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in drinking water – the largest-ever investment in tackling PFAS pollution. An additional $12 billion in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law supports general drinking water investments, including PFAS treatment. The investments are part of the,Justice40 Initiative,, which aims to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities.,These actions will help tackle PFAS pollution that has devastated communities like Oakdale, outside of St. Paul, Minnesota, where decades of PFAS-containing waste dumped by a chemical plant has contaminated the community’s drinking water. In this area, cancer was found to be a far more likely cause of death in children than in neighboring areas. The funding announced today will build on funding from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that is already helping communities address PFAS contamination, including a $33 million award for Tucson, Arizona to treat its PFAS-contaminated drinking water wells.,This funding also builds on,President Biden’s action plan,to,address PFAS pollution,, safeguard public health, and advance environmental justice – all while advancing the,Biden Cancer Moonshot,goal of cutting the cancer death rate by at least half by 2047 and preventing cancer before it starts by protecting communities from known risks associated with PFAS exposure.,As the first-ever Safe Drinking Water Act standard for PFAS – and the first for any new contaminants since 1996 – this rule sets health safeguards and will require public water systems to monitor and reduce the levels of PFAS in our nation’s drinking water, and notify the public of any exceedances of those levels. The rule sets drinking water limits for five individual PFAS, including the most frequently found PFOA and PFOS. Because PFAS can often be found together in mixtures, EPA is also setting a limit for any combination of four PFAS, including GenX Chemicals. This standard will reduce PFAS exposure in our drinking water to the lowest levels that are feasible for effective nationwide implementation.,Today’s announcements advance President Biden’s broader commitment to deliver clean water for every American. The President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $50 billion to upgrade water infrastructure – the largest investment in clean water in American history. This includes a historic $15 billion to replace toxic lead pipes and protect children from brain damage, as part of President Biden’s goal of replacing every lead pipe in the country within a decade.,Recent Federal Actions to Protect Communities from PFAS,Under President Biden’s leadership, nearly two dozen federal agencies and offices have made,systematic and substantive progress,to safeguard public health and protect the environment from PFAS in drinking water and beyond. This work is coordinated by the White House Council on Environmental Quality, which leads the Interagency Policy Committee on PFAS. Other new actions the Biden-Harris Administration has advanced to combat PFAS pollution over the past year include:,Protecting Firefighters from PFAS,: The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to protecting firefighters from the harmful effects of PFAS contained in fire suppressing agents and firefighter gear. The Department of Defense is offering PFAS blood tests to military firefighters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s,U.S. Fire Administration,is working to reduce PFAS exposure and promoting access to early cancer screenings and participation in the,National Firefighter Registry for Cancer,led by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as part of President Biden’s mission to end cancer as we know it.,Reducing PFAS in Fire Suppressants:,The Department of Defense (DoD) qualified three fluorine-free foams to,replace fluorinated Aqueous Film Forming Foam,for shore-based firefighting activities at military installations, which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has authorized for civilian airports. The FAA is assisting airports to,transition to these new foams,, and funding foam testing systems for airports that prevent environmental discharge. These changes will reduce the release of PFAS in the environment and protect the health of firefighters and local communities.,Supporting Healthcare Providers:,The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released the,PFAS: Information for Clinicians,resource guide. This information gives clinicians up-to-date resources and information they need to help patients with questions and concerns about PFAS exposure and health effects.,Phasing Out PFAS in Food Packaging:,The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the completion of the voluntary market phase-out of PFAS used on paper and paperboard food packaging,,eliminating the primary source of dietary exposure to PFAS,. FDA can now also,test for 30 PFAS in a variety of foods,to further protect people from dietary PFAS exposure.,Testing for and Cleaning Up PFAS Pollution:,EPA,continues to take key actions to address PFAS,. For example, EPA is,gathering data on 29 PFAS,in the nation’s drinking water systems has collaborated with,DoD to develop a method to test for 40 PFAS,in various media including biosolids, groundwater, and fish tissue. EPA also,updated its interim PFAS disposal and destruction guidance,and has released a new method to,test for 30 volatile fluorine-containing compounds,in air including potential products of incomplete combustion of PFAS. DoD recently identified,40 installations,where interim cleanup actions to prevent further PFAS migration are underway or will start in FY2024. These actions will address PFAS in groundwater to protect public health and the environment.,Reducing PFAS in Federal Procurement:,EPA and the U.S. General Services Administration,announced,this week that custodial contracts for federal buildings will now only use cleaning products certified to ecolabels such as EPA’s,Safer Choice,and certain,Green Seal,standards, thereby avoiding products that contain intentionally added PFAS. This shift will protect the environment, federal custodial workers, other federal employees, and those visiting government buildings.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",10-04-24,FACT SHEET: Biden-⁠Harris Administration Takes Critical Action to Protect Communities from PFAS Pollution in Drinking Water,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/10/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-critical-action-to-protect-communities-from-pfas-pollution-in-drinking-water/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past underinvestment in basic government technology and the crush of demand during the pandemic combined with ill-considered decisions to take down basic fraud controls at the onset of the pandemic led to a significant degree of fraud and identity theft of emergency benefits. While millions of Americans scraped by, bad actors exploited this national emergency, siphoning taxpayer-funded resources from small businesses and struggling families when they needed them most. This systemic fraud particularly impacted the small business programs and the new and expanded unemployment benefits that originated in early 2020.,Fortunately, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan led to a historic recovery across the country, with 15 million jobs created and the longest streak of sub-4% unemployment in more than 50 years. While this critical legislation and the initial pandemic legislation in 2020 were essential to mitigating the health and economic impacts of this unprecedented pandemic, the President has continued to call for further action to punish those who engaged in major and systemic fraud against the American people at the onset of the pandemic, to put in place stronger fraud and identity theft prevention measures going forward, and to protect Americans who were innocent victims of identity theft.,President Biden strongly supports this new legislation, as well as separate bipartisan legislation, that would enact his proposals to,:,This legislation is the latest in a series of bills—including several that are bipartisan—that would enact the President’s comprehensive pandemic anti-fraud proposal. This legislation, along with other bipartisan proposals, would:,I. Prosecute & Recover: Ensuring That Oversight and Enforcement Bodies Have the Resources to Prosecute Major Pandemic Fraud & Recoup Taxpayer Dollars:,We must empower law enforcement to investigate, pursue, prosecute, and recover money from those who have engaged in major or sophisticated fraud—from individuals who egregiously stole hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars from taxpayers to sophisticated criminal syndicates engaging in systemic identity theft. The oversight and law enforcement communities need both the time to prosecute the most serious and sophisticated cases and the resources to hire law enforcement and investigators for multi-year assignments. That’s why this legislation:,II. Prevent & Safeguard: Investing in Fraud and Identity Theft Prevention Going Forward:,The pandemic exposed significant vulnerabilities in our government benefits systems, especially regarding preventing systemic identity theft. Reliance on historic knowledge-based verification (e.g., Social Security number, date of birth) is more and more susceptible to attacks given the widespread ease of access by criminal syndicates to individuals’ personal information, which can be bought on the dark web for pennies. We also know that identity theft exacts a devastating toll on its victims. Ever-evolving and increasingly sophisticated identity theft schemes cause significant tax and credit harms to the victims of identity fraud as well as equally serious challenges in resolving those harms. That’s why this legislation:,Invests in Major Fraud Prevention Strategy:,Makes Critical Investments in Identity Theft Safeguards and Assistance for Victims of Identity Theft,:,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",09-04-24,FACT SHEET: President Biden’s Sweeping Proposals to Crack Down on Pandemic Fraud and Help Victims Recover Introduced in Congress,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/09/fact-sheet-president-bidens-sweeping-proposals-to-crack-down-on-pandemic-fraud-and-help-victims-recover-introduced-in-congress/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has now,shared,a tentative timeline for restoring access, and several large automobile importers have,committed,to take steps to try to return key cargo operations to the Port of Baltimore once it reopens.) The representatives underscored federal, state, and local governments’ continued efforts to reach out to impacted stakeholders, provide economic support to displaced workers and affected small businesses, monitor capacity at alternative ports, and coordinate timely, all-of-government responses to supply chain disruptions. Stakeholders from the auto, energy, chemical, and industrial sectors spoke with Federal representatives and offered suggestions for addressing specific concerns.,These convenings followed two stakeholder,listening session,s held the prior week,,one,led by Secretary Buttigieg with ports, labor groups, and industry partners focused on navigating temporary shipping and transportation diversions, and,another,led by the Department of Agriculture with,federal, state, agricultural, and food industry stakeholders,to assess potential short-term impacts to the agriculture and food sectors.,Auto industry stakeholders reported minimal impacts to operations, largely attributed to successful diversion of their cargo to other ports.  Auto sector representatives emphasized the importance of monitoring capacity at alternative East Coast ports, increasing trucking capacity to facilitate moving vehicles back to the Baltimore area in a timely manner, and ensuring the port returns to full operational capacity as soon as possible.,Representatives from the energy, chemical, and industrial sectors also reported minimal supply chain impacts at this time. Aluminum industry stakeholders stressed the importance of the Port of Baltimore to the aluminum sector and asked for the Administration’s continued support during the temporary disruption,The NEC reaffirmed the President’s commitment to “move heaven and earth” to fully reopen the port as soon as possible and to support the people of Baltimore.

FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you for joining our press call regarding the President’s ongoing efforts to cancel student debt.,Today’s call will begin with on-the-record remarks from White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.,After the remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session that will be on background and attributable to “senior administration officials.”,With that, Karine, I will turn it over to you.,Karine?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hello?  Can you hear me?,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Yes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, okay.  I apologize, guys.  I thought I was unmuted.,Thanks, Angelo.  And thanks, everyone, for joining.,From day one, President Biden vowed to fix the broken student loan system and make sure education was a ticket to the middle class and not a barrier to opportunity.  And our administration has taken historic steps to cancel student debt for 4 million Americans so far.,That’s 4 million people who have the breathing room to start businesses, buy homes, grow their families, and pursue their dreams.,We’ve helped these borrowers through fixing Public Service Loan Forgiveness, so nurses, teachers, and other public service workers who have served their communities so — for 10 years can actually get the debt relief they are entitled to under the law.,Since taking office, nearly 900,000 people have gotten Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  Before we came into office, only 7,000 people had ever seen that relief since the program started over 15 years ago.,The President launched a new repayment plan, the SAVE Plan — millions — pardon me — the SAVE Plan, which is the most affordable repayment plan ever, helping millions of borrowers have zero-dollar payments on their loans.,And earlier this year, we announced we were canceling the remaining student debt for over 150,000 borrowers enrolled in SAVE who took out loan balances of loans that — low balances of loans.  That debt cancellation came six months ahead of schedule.,Those are just some of the ways that the President and — and the — and the Biden-Harris administration have delivered student debt relief to millions of Americans.,And in,2021,[2022], President Biden announced that — announced a plan that would have elected of- — that would have canceled — I’m so sorry, guys — that would have canceled student debt for 40 million Americans.  But Republicans’ elected of- — elected officials sued us, and the Supreme Court sided with them, leaving — with them, leaving millions of people with the burden of student loan debt.,On the day of that decision, President Biden promised he — that he wouldn’t stop fighting to deliver debt relief, and he announced that his Department of Education would immediately pursue a new path for debt cancelation.,Tomorrow’s announcement is a result of that work.,Tomorrow, the President will announce his administration’s new plans to cancel debt — cancel student debt.  And when combined with actions we’ve already taken, 30 million people would benefit from student debt relief under the Biden-Harris administration if these plans are fa- — finalized.,I’ll let the Secretary talk more about the specific plans, but in total, they would help 23 million people get all of their interest canceled if their balance today is more than it was when they started paying back their loans.,They would deliver $5,000 in relief to over 10 million borrowers.  And millions of borrowers would see their entire debts wiped out.,If these plans are finalized as proposed, our administration plans to start implementing some of these plans, such as interest cancellation, as early as this fall.,Tomorrow, President Biden will deliver — will — will travel to Ma- — Madison, Wisconsin, where he will announce these plans and meet directly with borrowers who have benefited from his administration’s student debt relief efforts.,We have Vice President, Second Gentleman, Secretary Cardona all fanning out across the country to meet with Americans who have had their debt cancelation — cancelled by the Biden adm- — -Harris administration and hear what his relief has meant to them.,Vice President Harris will be in Philadelphia, the Second Gentleman will be in Phoenix, and Secretary Cardona will be in New York City.,I’ll close by saying that President Biden will use every tool available to cancel student loan debt for as many borrowers as possible, no matter how many times Republican elected officials try to stand in his way.,Thank you.  And I’ll turn it over to Secretary Cardona.,Secretary, the floor is yours.,SECRETARY CARDONA:  Thank you very much, Karine.  And I really want to thank everyone for joining in today.,When I became Education Secretary a little over three years ago, President Biden looked at me, and he said, “We’ve got a broken system, and I need you to fix it.”,When the Supreme Court struck down the President’s boldest student debt relief plan, within hours, we said, “We won’t be deterred.”  We announced a new rulemaking process designed to provide borrowers relief under the Higher Education Act.,And today’s announcement shows that we’re continuing to fulfill our promises.,As you know, the negotiated rulemaking process is how we change and improve our higher education policies.  As a result of that process, which we started last fall, the administration is announcing new proposals today to deliver student debt relief to as many as 30 million Americans.,That includes more than 25 million borrowers who owe more money than they did at the start of repayment due to runaway interest — again, a broken system.  It includes automatic debt relief for least 2 million borrowers who are eligible for existing loan forgiveness program or closed school loan discharges but who haven’t yet successfully enrolled in or applied for these programs.,It includes borrowers who have been living with their student loans for 20 years or more and who have not already had their debt forgiven.  And it includes borrowers who have been taken advantage of by career training programs that left them with high debt and low-value credentials or borrowers who attended schools with unacceptably high rates of student loan defaults.,If these plans are finalized as proposed, altogether, this administration will begin to cancel up to $20,000 in interest for millions of borrowers and full loan forgiveness for millions more this fall.,That’s on top of the $146 billion in student loan debt relief for four million Americans that we’ve already approved, more than any other administration in our country’s history.,We’ve also expanded Pell Grants to 1.7 million more Americans and are holding predatory institutions that cheated students accountable.,It bears repeating: We’re delivering as much relief as possible for as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible.,And what does that really mean for people?,It means breathing room.  It means freedom from feeling like your student loan bills compete with basic needs like grocery or healthcare.,It means the teacher I met in Philadelphia, who’d been teaching for 20 years, can finally afford to put a handicap-accessible bathtub in her house for her disabled husband thanks to the $20,000 in student loan debt relief she received.  Again, she’s been teaching for 20 years, and it was because of the debt relief that she can adjust the bathroom so that her husband can use it without issues.,Imagine that — working for 20 years and you can’t do that without the loan forgiveness.  That’s unacceptable.,Now, there’s an end to the nightmare of working hard, making loan payments, and still watching your loan balances get bigger and bigger month after month, and we’re proud to announce what we’re announcing today.,Generations of students can now imagine themselves pursuing higher education instead of ruling it out early, sometimes as early as middle school, because of the cost.  And as a former school principal, I remember talking to young students who thought college was out of reach for them as young people.,President Biden often says the one word that describes America is “possibility.”  And when I think about all the possibility and all the potential we can unlock when — when young people see that they can afford and access higher education, I think this work is nothing short of transformative.,That’s why we’re unapologetic about this fight.  Student loan forgiveness isn’t only about relief for today’s borrowers.  It’s about social mobility, economic prosperity, and creating an America that lives up to its highest ideals.,Again, thank you for joining.  And I’ll turn it back over to Angelo now, who will continue with the call.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you, Secretary Cardona.,At this point, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.  As a reminder, this will be on background and attributable to “senior administration officials.”,Please use the “raise hand” function on Zoom.  And I will give you all a minute to queue up.,Okay.  We will start — as you are called on, please identify yourself and your outlet.,We will start with Jennifer Jacobs.  Over to you.,Q    Hey there.  Karine mentioned that you think that this would be implemented in the fall.  But can you say, are you expecting that it would be implemented before the election?  That’s one question.,And then secondly, will this plan go to a comment period?  And if yes, there will be a comment period, when will that start?  Thank you.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  (Inaudible.)  So, yes, these rule- — these proposals will go out for public comment in the coming months.  And the goal is to start delivering relief early this fall.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you.  We will go to Michael next.  You should be unmuted now.,Q    Hey, thanks.  I appreciate being called on.  I have two questions sort of along the same lines of — of timing.,One is, you know, given that the public comment period will ask for months and that — I think one of the — I can’t remember if it was the Secretary or Karine talked about some of the programs being implemented by the fall, is there — is there an exp- — I mean, it feels like the calendar is working against you here, that it’s unlikely that a lot of this is going to be implemented much before the election or before the fall.,So, if you could talk a little bit more about which — which things you actually realistically think you could — you could put into effect.,And then secondly, but related, is: Can you talk a little bit about the likelihood of a legal challenge?  And if there is a legal challenge, doesn’t that suggest that, you know, then you’re adding months and months on top of — on top of that, which — which puts you well beyond — you know, well into a potential second term?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  With regard to the timing question, this is not outside the norm for what we’ve done to turn around rules from draft to final by the early fall.  And we do anticipate beginning to cancel the outstanding interest for borrowers early this fall and then working on debt relief for millions of others.,I’ll defer the questions on the legal challenges to others.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, just to echo [senior administration official] and, you know, the Secretary: The President’s goal has been to deliver as much relief to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  And so, you know, we are focused on that goal within the constraints of what we can do.  And [senior administration official] talked a little bit about, you know, our sense of where we are on that right now.,I think, with respect to the legal questions, you know, we know that some Republicans in Congress and some Republican attorneys general have opposed the administration’s efforts to prevent millions of middle-class Americans from receiving student debt relief.  And we know some of them have even challenged the President’s work to fix administration of flawed programs that were originally established by Congress through bipartisan legislation, even where that work is clearly legal.,So, it is unfortunate that Republican politicians have fought to deny breathing room to millions of working families who are struggling with student debt.  But after the Supreme Court weighed in on our original debt relief program, the President was quite clear, and he directed his administration to develop an alternative plan.  And this plan is being done under the Secretary’s longstanding authority under the Higher Education Act.,You know, we have studied the Supreme Court’s decision carefully.  We intend to pursue these regulations in a way that is entirely consistent with that decision.  The plans differ from the administration’s prior pandemic relief proposal in a number of significant ways, and the Department’s proceeding under different legal authority, which is longstanding.  And the plans involve different considerations by providing targeted relief to borrowers with particular circumstances.,So, you know, this isn’t the same plan.  And we feel confident going forward.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thanks, [senior administration official].  We’ll go to Zachary next.  You should be unmuted now.,Q    Hi there.  Yeah, thanks for doing this.  So, again, just following up on timing here.  So, you say that you’re expected to begin implementing some of this stuff by the fall.  Can you help me understand how that’s possible if the regulation that went through the neg reg isn’t expected to go into effect by July of next year?,And then, when can we expect the NPRM?  Is that going to be next month, a month after that?  You know, [senior administration official], you said “in the coming months.”,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don’t have an exact date for you on the NPRM, but it is coming.,And then the Secretary has the ability to designate provisions for early implementation.  As you may recall, we early implemented some parts of the SAVE program, which is why borrowers are already seeing more of their income protected.  It’s why they’re not seeing their balances grow from accumulating interest and why we are beginning to provide relief to borrowers with lower original loans for college now.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you.  We will go to Katie next.  You should be unmuted now.,Q    Hi, thanks.  This is Katie Lobosco at CNN.  Can you say, like, whether or not — are all these proposals, like, a one-time thing?  Like, at one point in time, people who qualify are going to get the debt relief, or could someone possibly qualify, like, years later?,And also, if I’m — and just for clarification, it seems like the interest cancellation is the biggest part of that.  Like, that would be 23 out of possibly 26 million people who are getting debt relief.  I just want to make sure that that’s how I should be understanding this.  Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It’s a mixture in these proposals.  I think, taken together with the other things the President has done, the goal is to, as the Secretary said, solve the student loan crisis and make loans more affordable on a permanent basis.,The interest forgiveness is currently crafted as a one-time benefit, for example, but going forward, borrowers will benefit from substantially more favorable treatment through the SAVE program and other borrowers will benefit from revised rules around interest capitalization.,So, overall, it is an attempt to build upon the progress the President has made to make sure that no borrowers are left with loans they can’t afford to repay and to substantially reduce the burden of student loans and give borrowers additional breathing room.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And just to —,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  (Inaudible.),SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  — (inaudible) thing that [senior administration official] said, you know, there are a lot of different pieces here.  And one thing to keep in mind is that, you know, there is potential overlap between the different populations, you know, that are subject to the various forms of relief that we’re proposing here.  And so, you know, in terms of the total numbers — right? — you know, people could be eligible for multiple channels.  And then, obviously, going forward, borrowers have access to programs like SAVE and PSLF.,So, you know, we believe we’re going to reach 30 million people, but, you know, underneath that, people could be accessing, you know, various provisions.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  And — and just to pile on on [senior administration official]’s last point about SAVE.   In SAVE, which is an ongoing program that’s widely available, if you have small balances, you can get forgiveness in as little as 10 years.  If you are repaying for 20 or 25 years, you get forgiveness.  And if you have a lower income, you can have zero payment and you’re not accruing interest.,And, in fact, the interest provision we’re talking about here is providing retrospectively, going backwards, an interest benefit that is available to everyone in SAVE right now on a forward-looking basis.,So, if you are paying back zero dollars or low le- — low amounts in the SAVE program every month, you’re not accruing interest.  And that’s because of the benefit of forgiveness of interest that’s built into SAVE.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you.  We will go to Michael next.  You should be unmuted now.,Q    Hey, it’s Michael Stratford at Politico.  Thanks for doing the call.,I’m wondering if you can just walk us through the math of how you get to the 30 million figure and if you could give us a little more detail on what exactly that figure includes and maybe doesn’t include.,It doesn’t look like you have, for example, an estimate for the hardship category.  And there was also, I think in one of the fact sheets, a number of 10 million borrowers getting at least $5,000 in debt relief or more.  I’m wondering if you can sort of be more specific about how these numbers all fit together.,Thanks.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can start.  I think we will have greater detail in coming months as we produce the additional rules that you have heard about.  And so — so, there will be an opportunity to look under the hood more.,But what we can say is that there are 25 million people benefiting from the interest forgiveness provision here.  And there are 4 million people getting full debt forgiveness.  And there are 10 million people getting more than $10,000 in forgiveness.  And that when you sum the effects of all the forgiveness provisions that we are talking about here, you get over that 30 million figure.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, just to add to that.  As [senior administration official] said, you know, 25 million in this interest category.  There’s a number — there’s another 2 million, approximately, we think are in the sort of eligible but ha- — you know, for forgiveness — but haven’t applied, mostly due to SAVE.  And then we have about 2 million — around 2 million that are in the category of loans that are about 20 years or more old.,And then in the category of low financial value programs, we think that that is, you know, about a fifth of a million existing borrowers and more sort of into the future.,And as you noted, with respect to hardship, you know, that will be an additional population as well that will cover additional people.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you.  We will go to Andrew next.  You should be unmuted now.,Q    Thanks.,Can you talk a little bit about if you’ve projected the potential economic effects of this sort of mass-level forgiveness?  Any concern that it could be inflationary?,And then, on the legal theory, you said you studied the — the Supreme Court opinion.  On the first page of the opinion in — in June last year, Justice Roberts said that the Higher Education Act can cancel or reduce loans in — in, quote, “certain limited circumstances.”  Any concern that he’s sort of sending a signal that a wide use of this would get struck down by the Court?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I’ll take the second question first.,You know, as I noted, we’ve studied the opinion carefully.  I think, you know, what you hear us talking about rolling out here is a variety of specific interventions and proposals that address specific situations and specific populations in ways that we feel very confident are covered by what the Secretary’s longstanding authority under HEA allows him to do.  And we’re confident that we’re acting within the scope of the law, as set forth by the Supreme Court.,On the question of economic impact, you know, we have some CEA analysis that’s coming that we can follow up with you on around the plan.  I would say, generally, we know that student debt relief leads to economic mobility.  We know it leads to people contributing to the economy, being in a better position to be able to, for example, take out mortgages to buy homes and loans to start businesses.,So, we know it’s good for people.  We know it’s good for the economy.,We’re not concerned about an inflationary effect based on the analysis the CEA has done, you know, and we’ll have more detail on that that we can share.,But we do feel good about its effect on economic growth and economic mobility and improving the ability of families to really be able to get that breathing room that the President has talked about and that the Secretary talked about in these sorts of situations.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you.  We’ll have a time for a couple more questions.  We will go into Ayelet next.  You should be unmuted now.,Q    Hey.  This is Ayelet Sheffey with Business Insider.,Can you confirm whether all of this relief will be automatic?  Or will there be any actions that borrowers have to take to be eligible?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our goal is for the vast majority of this relief to be automatic.  Obviously, when you start talking about hardship, there are some things there that we’re looking to make as automatic as possible, but there may be details that we don’t have available to us.  But our goal is for the overwhelming majority of things like interest, loans that are older, borrowers that attended programs that didn’t deliver financial value — to do that all automatically.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you.  And we will go to Michael Jones next.  You should be unmuted now.,Q    Thanks so much for doing this.  And thanks for taking my question.  Michael Jones from Once Upon a Hill.,I’m curious — you know, obviously the Supreme Court made the decision last year.  The President has taken a lot of executive action.  I’m curious: Behind the scenes, have there been any conversations with congressional leaders, with members of any — either party to see if there’s any consensus around any legislative action that could be taken by Congress?,A lot of this conversation is focused on the Supreme Court decision and the President’s, I think, executive actions.  I understand the mar- — the margins aren’t there, you know, vote wise for as much as the President would probably like.  But I’m curious if there’s any — been any conversation behind the scenes with Congress about any legislative action on this issue.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks, Michael, for the question.,You know, we can’t speak to that specifically.  But what I can say is, you know, as you know, there are things that could be done by legislation and there are things that the President can do administratively under preexisting authority, which has been granted to him by Congress.,So, for example, when you think about SAVE and PSLF, these are programs that have been created and improved pursuant to acts of Congress.  And when you think about the authority in the Higher Education Act, you know, that is a law that was passed by Congress and authority that was delegated to the Secretary.,And so, consistent with the President’s directives to us, to his team, to do as much as we can within the law, you know, we are using that as the basis for the announcements that we’re making, you know, today and tomorrow.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you.  And our last question will come from the CBS desk, if you could please identify yourself.,Q    Hi.  This is Bo Erickson.,Just a clarification on the interest component here.  Is it $20,000 of interest for everyone but then lower-income and middle-income borrowers can have more than $20,000 forgiven in interest?  Can you just clarify that?,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That’s right.,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So —,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Oh, go ahead, [senior administration official].,SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It’s — it’s $20,000 for everyone.  And then, if you are in either the SAVE or the IDR plan and you have a low or middle income — so, a hundred — up to $120,000 for an individual or $240,000 for a married couple — then you can have all of your accrued interest forgiven.,MR. FERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ:  Thank you.  And that’s all the time we have today.,The embargo time for this call and the materials will now be 5:00 a.m. Eastern time — 5:00 a.m. Eastern time.  You all will receive a note from us with embargoed materials and the corrected time.,Thank you, again, for joining us, and we look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.,7:02 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Semiconductors – those tiny chips smaller than the tip of your finger – power everything from smartphones to cars to satellites and weapons systems. America invented these chips, but over time, we went from producing nearly 40% of the world’s capacity to just over 10%, and none of the most advanced chips, exposing us to significant economic and national security vulnerabilities. I was determined to turn that around, and thanks to my CHIPS and Science Act – a key part of my Investing in America agenda – semiconductor manufacturing and jobs are making a comeback.,Today, we continue building on that historic progress, with the Department of Commerce announcing a preliminary agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to support the construction of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing facilities right here in the United States. Thanks to this investment, TSMC will also build a third chip factory in Phoenix, increasing its total investment in Arizona to $65 billion and creating over 25,000 direct construction and manufacturing jobs, along with thousands of indirect jobs. These facilities will manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, putting us on track to produce 20% of the world’s leading-edge semiconductors by 2030. The agreement also dedicates $50 million of CHIPS funding to training and developing the local workforce, so workers don’t have to leave their hometowns to find good-paying jobs in innovative industries.,A year and a half ago, I toured the site of TSMC’s first new fab in Phoenix, Arizona. TSMC’s renewed commitment to the United States, and its investment in Arizona represent a broader story for semiconductor manufacturing that’s made in America and with the strong support of America’s leading technology firms to build the products we rely on every day.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",08-04-24,Statement from President Joe Biden on CHIPS and Science Act Preliminary Agreement with TSMC,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/08/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-chips-and-science-act-preliminary-agreement-with-tsmc/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Today, Biden-Harris Administration leaders will fan out across the country as President Biden announces his Administration’s new plans to cancel student debt for tens of millions of Americans,. The plans, if implemented, would provide debt relief to over 30 million Americans when combined with actions the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to cancel student debt over the past three years.,While Republican elected officials try every which way to block millions of their own constituents from receiving student debt cancellation, President Biden has vowed to use every tool available to cancel student debt for as many borrowers as possible, as quickly as possible. Today, President Biden will travel to Madison, Wisconsin to announce these new plans, while Vice President Harris will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will travel to Phoenix, Arizona, and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona will travel to New York City to meet with borrowers benefitting from the Administration’s student debt relief actions.,President Biden from Day One has worked to fix the student loan system and make sure higher education is a ticket to the middle class – not a barrier to opportunity – because he knows that debt cancellation not only benefits borrowers, it,benefits,the entire economy.,To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved $146 billion in student debt relief for 4 million Americans through more than two dozen executive actions. That includes fixing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Income-Driven Repayment plans, so borrowers finally get the relief they are entitled to under the law. It also includes launching the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever – the,SAVE,plan – which cuts undergraduate loan payments in half, ensures borrowers never see their balance grow from unpaid interest, helps drop millions of borrowers’ monthly payments down to $0, and cancels debt for low-balance borrowers faster. Nearly 8 million borrowers have enrolled in the SAVE plan, 4.5 million borrowers have a monthly payment of $0 under the plan, and an additional 1 million borrowers have a monthly payment of less than $100.  The Biden-Administration has also secured the largest increase to Pell Grants in a decade and has taken significant steps to hold colleges accountable for leaving borrowers with mountains of debt and without good job prospects.,Last June, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision blocking the Biden-Harris Administration’s original student debt relief plan, President Biden vowed to keep fighting to deliver student debt relief to borrowers held back by the burden of student loan debt. Immediately following that, the Department of Education began pursuing an alternative path to debt relief through negotiated rulemaking under the Higher Education Act.,Today’s announcement lays out the plans the Biden-Harris Administration is pursuing through that effort. In total, these plans would fully eliminate accrued interest for 23 million borrowers, would cancel the full amount of student debt for over 4 million borrowers, and provide more than 10 million borrowers with at least $5,000 in debt relief or more.,Canceling runaway interest for millions of borrowers,More than 25 million borrowers owe more than they originally borrowed, including many who have made years of payments, due to the interest rates on Federal student loans. President Biden will announce plans that, if finalized as proposed, would cancel up to $20,000 of the amount a borrower’s balance has grown due to unpaid interest on their loans after entering repayment, regardless of their income. Low and middle-income borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan or any other income-driven repayment (IDR) plan would be eligible for the entire amount their balance has grown since entering repayment to be canceled under the Administration’s plans. This group of borrowers includes single borrowers who earn $120,000 or less and married borrowers who earn $240,000 or less. No application will be needed for borrowers to receive this relief if the plan is implemented as proposed.,Millions of the borrowers who could be helped by these plans have continued to see their balances grow because of accrued interest, despite making their monthly payments.  Many have also had this unpaid interest capitalized, meaning it is added to their principal balance and borrowers are now paying interest on that higher amount. The Administration’s plan would forgive interest balances built up to date for 25 million borrowers, with 23 million likely to have all of their balance growth forgiven.,This plan builds off the actions the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to prevent the negative effects of excessive interest accrual on student loans going forward by eliminating all interest capitalization not required by law. The SAVE Plan does not charge unpaid interest for borrowers who make their monthly payments, and has canceled interest for at least 4.5 million borrowers to date.,Automatically canceling debt for borrowers eligible for loan forgiveness under SAVE, PSLF, closed school discharge, or other forgiveness programs but not enrolled,Too many borrowers eligible for relief – including immediate cancellation –have not been able to overcome paperwork requirements, bad advice, or other obstacles. Since its first days in office, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to get borrowers the relief to which they are entitled.,Today, the Administration is proposing to automatically cancel debt for borrowers otherwise eligible for relief through the SAVE plan, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or other forgiveness opportunities like closed school loan discharges but who have not successfully applied for that assistance.,Under SAVE, borrowers who originally took out $12,000 or less in loans and have been in repayment for 10 years are eligible to get their remaining debt canceled. For every additional $1,000 in loans they took out (up to $21,000 total for undergraduate loans and $26,000 total for graduate loans), a borrower is eligible for relief after an additional year of repayment. For example, if a borrower took out $13,000 in loans, they would be eligible for debt cancellation after 11 years in repayment.,Under Public Service Loan Forgiveness, borrowers in public service for 10 years who have made 120 months of qualifying payments can get their remaining student debt canceled.,The Administration’s plans would allow the Department of Education to use data it has on hand to identify borrowers otherwise eligible for this type of relief without requiring them to apply for these programs. The Administration expects this action would cancel debt for around 2 million borrowers across the country.,Canceling student debt for borrowers who entered repayment over 20 years ago,More than 2.5 million borrowers have had their share of student loans for two decades or longer and still carry debt from long-ago loans. The Biden-Harris Administration has already cancelled $45.6 billion in student debt so far for nearly 1 million borrowers who have been in repayment for at least 20 years, but never got the relief they were entitled to because of administrative problems with income-driven repayment plans. The Administration’s new proposals, if finalized as proposed, would cancel student debt for borrowers who first entered repayment 20 or more years ago. Borrowers with only undergraduate debt would qualify for forgiveness if they first entered repayment 20 years ago (on or before July 1, 2005), and borrowers with any graduate school debt would qualify if they first entered repayment 25 or more years ago (on or before July 1, 2000). Both Direct Loans and Direct Consolidation Loans that repay only undergraduate study or graduate study for 20 or 25 years respectively are eligible for relief in this proposal.  Borrowers would not need to be on an income-driven repayment plan to qualify.,Canceling student debt for borrowers who enrolled in low-financial-value programs,One of the Biden-Harris Administration’s top priorities when it comes to higher education is holding colleges accountable when they leave students with mountains of debt and without good job prospects. To this end, the Department has taken significant steps to crack down on colleges that provide low-value programs to borrowers, when they cheat students and families, and when they close unexpectedly – leaving borrowers and taxpayers to foot the bill.,Today, President Biden is announcing his Administration’s plans that, if finalized as proposed, would cancel student debt for loans associated with institutions or programs that lost their eligibility to participate in the Federal student aid program or were denied recertification because they cheated or took advantage of students. Further, borrowers who attended institutions or programs that closed and failed to provide sufficient value— for example that leave graduates with unaffordable loan payments or earnings no better than what someone with a high school diploma earns— would be eligible for relief under this proposal.,Canceling student debt for borrowers experiencing hardship paying back their loans,President Biden and his Administration recognize that the current student loan system and repayment programs don’t reach all borrowers, and for many Americans student loans continue to be a barrier for them participating in the economy, accessing economic mobility, or pursuing their dreams. The Administration’s plan for student debt relief will also include a plan that would cancel student debt for borrowers experiencing hardship in their daily lives that prevents them from fully paying back their loans now or in the future.,This plan could provide relief to millions of borrowers who experience hardship—such as borrowers who are at high risk of defaulting on their student loans, who could be eligible for automatic relief, or families who are burdened with other expenses like medical debt or child care who can apply for relief in the future.,Providing relief to millions of borrowers this year,The Biden-Harris Administration plans to release proposed rules on these plans over the coming months. If these plans are finalized as proposed, this fall the Administration would begin canceling up to $20,000 in interest for millions of borrowers and full loan forgiveness for millions more.,Building off unparalleled record canceling student debt under President Biden,Today’s announcements follow historic actions the President and his Administration have already taken to approve student debt cancellation for nearly 4 million Americans and make student loan payments easier for millions more through the SAVE plan. These actions have benefited borrowers from all 50 states and U.S. territories, borrowers from different walks of life, and borrowers of all ages. To date:,President Biden will not stop fighting to cancel more student debt for as many Americans as possible, and today’s announcements are a key step forward in that effort.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",08-04-24,President Joe Biden Outlines New Plans to Deliver Student Debt Relief to Over 30 Million Americans Under the Biden-⁠Harris Administration,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/08/president-joe-biden-outlines-new-plans-to-deliver-student-debt-relief-to-over-30-million-americans-under-the-biden-harris-administration/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDT,MODERATOR:  Looks like most folks are on.  Kirby has a few words at the top, and then we’ll take as many questions as we can in the next few minutes.  Thanks, everyone.,MR. KIRBY:  Hey, everybody.  Just a quick overview on the latest in the Middle East.,First, yesterday we saw more than 300 trucks enter Gaza.  That’s more trucks than any single day since the war began.  And that’s progress.  But obviously, we need to see this number increase, and we need to see it sustained, to really address the dire humanitarian situation there in Gaza.,Also over the weekend, Ambassador Lew and David Satterfield had productive discussions with Minister of Defense Gallant, with the IDF, and with COGAT officials on the steps that the Israeli government has taken to implement the measures that the President discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu in their call last week.  That includes to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, sharpen up the deconfliction process, and again, to reduce the risk and raise the confidence level of humanitarian workers.,We certainly welcome all these steps.  Again, the President requested to get more aid into Gaza and address civilian harm.  But what we need to see, as we’ve said before, is that these steps are implemented and then sustained over time.  That includes major improvements, again, as I said, to the deconfliction process.  And we’re going to keep pressing the Israelis on exactly that.,Second, just to provide an update on our review of the IDF independent investigation of the killing of World Central Kitchen workers in Gaza, we continue to review the conclusions of that investigation that was released by the IDF.  I know everybody is very curious about when we’re going to be done with that, what we’re going to say about it.  We’re still working our way through it.  I don’t have an update for you today.,Third, as has been publicly reported, Director Burns was in Cairo over the weekend as part of the hostage negotiations.  I don’t have a specific update to provide you today, but the administration is doing everything possible to broker a deal that secures the release of all the hostages and leads to an immediate ceasefire.  And there’s simply no higher priority.,Where we are now is that a proposal has been presented to Hamas, and we’re waiting on Hamas’s response.  As you all know from tracking this before, a response from Hamas to any particular proposal, one way or another, can often take a matter of days just because of the nature of communications with them and with Mr. Sinwar.  So that’s the best I have for an update for you.  I don’t have more detail.,I’m not going to — as much as I know everybody is interested, I’m not going to get into what the specifics of that proposal is or what it looks like or what was negotiated in Cairo.  That would be one of the surest ways to torpedo this, and I’m not going to do that.,I do want to add on the hostage front, though, that Jake will be meeting with family members of the U.S. citizens that are being held hostage.  And he’ll be meeting them tonight, later this afternoon, here at the White House.,Now, just on the state visit: As you all know, the President and First Lady are prepared to welcome Prime Minister Kishida and Mrs. Kishida of Japan to the White House for an official visit.  That will include a state dinner.  This visit will be a celebration of our bilateral relationship as it evolves into a global partnership that is a force for peace and prosperity; also a recognition of the significance of our alliance.  It builds on the immense progress between our two nations to help create a safer and more secure Indo-Pacific.,You’ll be hearing more from us soon, obviously, on the wide range of deliverables that will be announced by the leaders on Wednesday.  I’m not going to get ahead of that.  But I do want to highlight that, on Thursday, President Biden will welcome President Marcos of the Philippines to the White House for his second bilateral meeting here at the White House and also a chance to host the first-ever trilateral leaders’ summit between the United States, Japan, and the Philippines.  And again, we’ll have much more to say about that as we get closer to Thursday.,The United States, Japan, and the Philippines are three closely aligned maritime democracies with increasingly convergent strategic objectives, interests, and, frankly, concerns in areas like the South China Sea.,The leaders are expected to announce new initiatives across a range of important issues during this historic trilateral meeting.  It’s the first ever at the leader level, and so we’re going to look to find ways to continue to deepen the collaboration with our closest partners, again, to ensure a free, open, prosperous, secure Indo-Pacific.,And with that, I’m happy to take some questions.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our first question will go to Aamer with the AP.,Q    Hey, thanks, John.  Thanks, Sam.  Any updates on scheduling of the Rafah meetings in Washington?,And then, second, will the President or anyone at the White House be meeting with Mr. Lapid while he’s in town this week?  I believe he is meeting today at the State Department.,And I know you don’t want to talk about specifics on the Cairo talks, but generally speaking, is there any reason to be more optimistic that a hostage deal can come through soon, coming out of the talks this weekend?  Thank you, John.,MR. KIRBY:  Aamer, can you ask me your first question again?  I’m sorry, I was trying to write fast and I —,Q    Sorry.  On the Rafah meetings that were expected for Washington —,MR. KIRBY:  Oh, yeah.,Q    — is there any updates on timing on that?,MR. KIRBY:   Okay, thanks.  So, on Rafah, still no date certain.  Nothing set for the calendar.  We were hoping to be able to do it this week, but I’m not sure that it’s going to actually happen this week.  I think folks are really sort of circling around sometime next week.  But stay tuned, obviously when we know something.  But I’m not expecting one this week, but we’re still working the calendar items.,On Lapid, look, since the war started, Jake has met with Ron Dermer, Minister Gallant, Benny Gantz, Mr. Bennett, obviously and — and the Speaker of the Knesset.  And yes, he will be meeting with Mr. Lapid.  So he’s always made it a priority to meet with senior Israeli officials when they’re in town; Mr. Lapid is no exception.  And Jake will be having a discussion with him.,On the hostage deal, I really can’t say, honestly, Aamer, as — I went, really, as far as I could go in my topper.  There was a serious round of discussions and negotiations over the weekend.  Mr. Burns participated in that and represented us in those talks.  And at the end of the weekend, a proposal was submitted to Hamas, and now it’s going to be up to Hamas to come through.,So what the chances are of that, I wouldn’t want to handicap it, except to say that — and I think it should be plainly obvious just by the amount of shuttle diplomacy that we’re doing and our counterparts are doing — we’re taking this very, very seriously.  And we really want to do — come to closure on a hostage deal as soon as possible.  Because again, with that hostage deal comes a ceasefire of some weeks’ duration, hopefully around six weeks, which could do a lot to ease the burden on the Gazan people and to help us improve that humanitarian assistance.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Justin with Bloomberg.,Q    Hey, guys.  Thanks for doing this.  Two quick ones.  The first was: I was wondering if you could just kind of give a general reaction to the Israeli statements over the weekend that were positive on ceasefire negotiations and possibly pulling some troops out of Gaza.  You know, are you encouraged by those?  Are you still kind of wait and see?  Just whatever you have on that.,And then, I know you said you didn’t have an update on the talks themselves, but I was wondering if you had a response to the — if you could share if there was a response to the letters the President sent to the leaders of Egypt and Qatar on the hostage talks.  And if there was response, anything you could share there.,MR. KIRBY:  So as we’ve said before, the announcements and the statements coming out of the Israeli government over the last two, three days are welcomed.  And we are, as I said in my opening statement, beginning to see them move on some of the very specific things, the concrete steps that the President asked them to do.,So, again, these are welcome steps.  These are welcome announcements.  These are welcome statements.  But really, what it comes down to is sustainability and a commitment to meet these — commitment to follow through on these steps over time.,I don’t have a response to speak to in terms of the President’s communications with the Emir of Qatar and with President Sisi of Egypt.  Those letters were sent to convey the President’s strong view that we want them to urge Hamas to commit to this hostage deal and to abide by those commitments.  And as I said, a proposal was offered, and we’re going to wait and see what Hamas’s response is.,And I honestly think that anything more that I would say — even though you’re not really asking about the hostage negotiations; you’re asking about the letters — anything more I would say at this point, you know, could potentially put that response in some kind of jeopardy.  And I just don’t want to do that, not when so many lives are hanging in the balance.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Andrea Mitchell with NBC.,Q    Hi, thank you.  Question about Khan Younis.  How are you interpreting it?  Have you sought any clarification about the repositioning of those troops, the withdrawal, as to whether it’s preparatory to something else, or is it a routine reservist, you know, withdrawal?  Or the rest, are they going back to their civilian jobs?  Can you give us any clarification about the military moves this weekend that were ordered?,MR. KIRBY:  Andrea, I’m really not going to do that.  I mean, that’s really for the Israeli Defense Force to speak to.  It’s their troops, their units, their movements.  And the last thing I’m going to do is try to talk for another military.  All I can —,Q    But have we sought any clarification from them as to what they’re up to?,MR. KIRBY:  All I can say is —,Q    Because that’s been one of the issues on the table.,MR. KIRBY:  All I can tell you, Andrea, is that they’ve made it clear that these troops have been on the ground for four months consecutive, fighting, and they needed to be refit and get some rest.  So that’s our best understanding of what they’re doing.,I don’t have any internal communications we might have had with them about this.  I will just add that we have consistently made clear that we don’t support a major ground operation in Rafah.  I would also add that we don’t see any signs that such a major ground operation is imminent or that these troops are being repositioned for that kind of a ground operation.,The last thing I would add is that we’re still looking to have a conversation with the Israelis about Rafah here in coming days, hopefully sometime next week.  And the Israelis have assured us that there will be no operations in and around Rafah until we have had a chance to talk to them at greater length about the viable options and alternatives to a major ground operation.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Andrea Shalal with Reuters.  Andrea, you should be able to unmute yourself.  Okay, we see you unmuted yourself, but we cannot hear you.,Q    Okay, can you hear me now?,MODERATOR:  We can.  Yep.,Q    Okay, thanks so much.  Thanks for taking my question.,John, I’m just wondering about the aid — you know, flow of aid into Gaza and what you’re seeing there.  And then, you know, like, how many trucks do you think are possible per day?  Three hundred was a lot compared to what we’d seen earlier, but is still not — you know, not sufficient.  So what are you looking for there?,And then, on the investigation into the World Central Kitchen thing, can you give us any more details in terms of what you see there?  And I know that this has been asked before, but do you — you know, is there thinking about whether that did, in fact, amount to a war crime?  Thanks.,MR. KIRBY:  Look, on the trucks, what we’ve said and what we communicated to the Israelis is we’d like to see the flow,in the very, very near future get up to between 3- to 350 per day.  And today, as I said, we saw more than 300.  So that’s a good start but still not up to the upper range of that and — of the 350.  And, again, what matters is how it can be sustained over time.,I have nothing for you on the investigation.  As I said, we’re still working our way through it.  I just don’t have any updates for you on that.,And as I’ve said before, the State Department continues, as always, through their ongoing processes, to review operations by militaries that receive, you know, U.S. security assistance.  It’s an evolving thing that they watch it, they examine facts as they develop.  They have not made any determinations at this time with respect to war crimes.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We’re going to try to speed through three more questions before we have to jump.,Our next question will go to Alex Marquardt with CNN.,Q    Thank you, guys.  Thanks for doing this.  John, in terms of what a potential Iranian retaliation could look like for the consulate strike last week, I know you guys have — I was wondering whether you guys could say a little bit more about what you may be tracking in terms of specific Iranian plans.  Do you have an expectation of whether targets could be civilian or military, U.S. or Israeli; whether Iran would retaliate themselves or have this done through proxies?  Thanks.,MR. KIRBY:  Alex, I’m going to be real careful here, because you’re talking about some intelligence assessments.  And I’m just not going to get into that.,I will just tell you that, number one, we know that Iran has made very public threats against Israel itself.  And one of the things that the President said in his call with Prime Minister Netanyahu was that the Israeli government could count on the United States’ support for any self-defense needs against threats directly by Iran to Israel — again, threats that Iran has made public.,Number two, our own people — not just our troops, but our diplomatic personnel, as well, in Iraq and Syria — are under constant threat.  We take that seriously, and we take the appropriate force protection measures we need to as the threat changes to make sure that they can protect themselves.  And that has not changed; that will not change.  We’re continuing to do that.,But we take the threat to our own people and our own facilities seriously.  And we know that those groups, many of the groups that conduct those kinds of attacks, are supported, funded, resourced by the IRGC.,So I think I’ll just leave it at that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Robin Wright with the New Yorker.,Q    Thanks, John.  A related question.  Has the United States received any message, directly or indirectly, that Iran might refrain from a military response for the attack on its facility in Damascus if the U.S. brokers a ceasefire?  In other words, is there any kind of understanding or sub-deal, deal parallel to the negotiations, on a ceasefire in Gaza?,And also, as related to Alex’s question, is the U.S. still seeing signs of Iran positioning to respond in any way?  And if so, where?  I know it’s related, but is there any detail you can provide, insight?,MR. KIRBY:  I’m sorry, Robin, the second part of the question was what?,Q    Well, related to Alex’s question.  And are you still seeing signs, as U.S. officials said on Friday, that Iran is positioning for a response, both missiles and drones?,MR. KIRBY:  Oh.  Oh, I gotcha.  I gotcha.  I thought that was — I guess I should be more clear.  I thought it was kind of implied in my answer to Alex that, of course, we’re still considering this an active threat.,And look, I don’t really have a comment to make on the report that Iran claims they would refrain from responding if there was a ceasefire.  Quite frankly, if Iran desires a ceasefire in Gaza, then it should pull out all the stops to do what they can to press Hamas to accept the deal that’s on the table, to accept the proposal that was worked up this weekend, if that’s what they really want.  We want a ceasefire too.  They can lean on Hamas.  That would be the best outcome.,And look, we want a ceasefire, again, that would release women, the wounded, sick, the elderly.  That’s really the focus.  But if Iran is serious about a ceasefire, they’ll use the influence they have with Hamas to press for a positive response to that proposal.,Q    But has the U.S. received any message, directly or indirectly, to that effect?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything to offer on that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question, and unfortunately our last, will go to Nadia.  Nadia, you should be able to unmute yourself.,Q    Hi.  Can you hear me now?,MODERATOR:  We sure can.,Q    Oh, thank you, Sam.  Hi, John.  You said that, today, for the first time since October 7th, that 350 trucks of aid are entering Gaza.  I’m just wondering why it took that long.  And why — what were the major obstacles that prevented this vital aid to come to Gaza, especially for (inaudible)?  Is it the phone call from the President?  Is it a change of policy on the U.S. that made this happening?,MODERATOR:  Nadia, we can’t really understand you.  Are you on speakerphone?,MR. KIRBY:  Nadia, I could not pick up most of your question.,MODERATOR:  Now you’re breaking up.  So we’re going to move on and try get one more question.,We’ll go to Hiba.  Hiba, you should be able to unmute yourself.,Q    Yes, Sam.  Thank you.  Thanks, John.  I want to follow up on the question regarding the Iranian consulate and the message that — reports on the message that the Iranian conveyed to the U.S. that they will go — they will refrain from hitting in case there’s a ceasefire.  Is it fair to say, John, that this report is not accurate?  Are you trying to tell us that?,And my second question: On the strike itself against the Iranian consulate, some (inaudible) are saying it was unwise by the Israeli.  What’s your position?  We never understand what the administration position on the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t have anything more to say about the strike in Damascus, except that we weren’t involved in any way whatsoever.  And I need to just leave it at that.,And as I said to Robin’s question on this, I don’t have anything further to add on Iranian claims that they’re making this sort of promise.  You got to take pretty much everything that the Iranians say with a huge grain of salt.,I would just add that if they’re serious about wanting a ceasefire, then they should put the pressure on Hamas to accept the proposal that’s on the table.  That’s it.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And thank you, everyone, for joining us.  Sorry this was a quick one.  But as always, reach out to the NSC distro if we weren’t able to get to you.  Thanks.,11:58 A.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",08-04-24,On-the-Record Press Gaggle by White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/04/08/on-the-record-press-gaggle-by-white-house-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-9/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Aboard Air Force One,En Route Madison, Wisconsin,12:25 P.M. EDT,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  Here we go.  So, from day one, President Biden vowed to fix the broken student loan system and make sure education was a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity.,Today, we are heading to Madison, Wisconsin, where the President will announce his new plans to cancel student debt.  If these plans are finalized, more than 30 million people would stand to benefit from student debt relief when combined with the steps we have already taken.,The Vice President, Second Gentleman, and Secretary Cardona are also fanning out across the country to talk to Americans who have received debt relief thanks to the Biden-Harris administration.  The President will continue to use every tool to deliver as much relief as possible to as many people as possible, no matter how many times Republican elected officials try to stand in his way.,Second, last night, the President, as you all know, called Coach Dawn Staley from the University of South Carolina to congratulate her and the team on their undefeated season and national championship.  Yesterday’s game was fantastic and capped off a woman’s tournament that generated record ratings.,On behalf of the White House, we congratulate the University of South Carolina and all the athletes who have accomplished so much for their teams and their — and their sport.  It was really a March Madness to remember.,And finally to mark the eclipse, the White House released a video — hopefully, you all got to see it before we took off this morning — on social media with the President reminding people to wear protective eyewear.  The President hopes that everyone enjoys the eclipse but hopes they also play it safe and protect their eyes.,With that, I am happy to take some of your question.,Darlene.,Q    Thank you.  Congress is back this week.  Apart from the national security supplemental, money for Ukraine and Israel, is there any legislation the President would want to see Congress send him before they break again for recess in a couple of weeks?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, thank you for the question.  I think it’s really important.  You mentioned the national security supplemental, which we all know passed in a bipartisan fashion, overwhelmingly, in the Senate, 79-29.  And now we want to see Speaker Johnson put that national security supplemental on the floor.  We know it would get overwhelming support.  We want to see that moving forward.,We also want to see Congress move forward with the border security negotiation that came out of the Senate.  It was done in a bipartisan way.  The President, obviously, was involved in that.  And so, we know that the last president, President Trump, told Republicans to reject that proposal and not put the — not put majority of Americans first.,A majority of Americans want to see that proposal move forward or — not even the proposal — want us to take action on the im- — immigration system, which has been broken for decades.  And we want to see that proposal move forward because we believe that proposal, if it were to move forward, it got to the President’s desk, and he were to sign it, it would be not just the toughest but also the fairest — getting support from U.S. Chamber of Commerce and also the Border control — Patrol folks.,In addition, there is — the Senate should pass the bipartisan tax deal passed by the House, which would expand the Child Tax Credit for millions of families and support construction of hundreds of thousands of affordable homes.,Congress should extend funding for the,Affordability,[Affordable] Connectivity Program — you heard us talk about that recently — which has helped over 23 million households save 30 to 75 bucks each month on their monthly Internet bills.,And then, finally, Congress should pass the bipartisan bill to reauthorize and reform Section 702, which provides irreplaceable information on almost every threat that the American people expect their government to find and stop: terrorist plots, illicit fentanyl, ransomware and other cyberattacks, Russian — Russian war crimes, and many, many more.,So, there’s a lot for Congress to do, and we hope that they take — they take action.,Q    Sec- — second, will the President be able to see any of the solar eclipse —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So —,Q    — today?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — I — I don’t have any information on that to share with you.  Obviously, as I stated at the top, the President wants to make sure — it’s exciting time.  We know millions of Americans are excited about the — the solar eclipse that’s going to happen today.  We want to make sure that they protect their eyes, they have the protective eyewear.  I just don’t have anything to share on — on — right now, at this moment, on — on the President.,Q    On Section 702, does the White House have a contingency plan if Congress allows this to lapse?  And then what would be — you mentioned a few of the risks, but what are some of the ramifications if this provision expires?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I — I don’t want to get ahead of the most important point — right? — the provision underpinning the government’s most critical foreign intelligence tool, Section 702, is set to expire on April 19th and — along with other provisions.  And we’re — and we’re laser-focused on working with the Hill to prevent that from happening.  And so, that’s our focus.  That’s what we’re going to do.,And — and I — I think I’ve mentioned this already about what it — what — what Section [7]02 provides: irreplaceable information on almost every threat that the American people ex- — expect their government to find and stop.  And so, we urge Congress to — to reauthorize it now.,The bipartisan bill that the House will take up this week includes some of the most extensive reform we’ve ever seen to protect the privacy of Americans and to strengthen guardrails to ensure accountability and transparency in how this critical authority is used.,The administration strongly, strongly supports the reauthoration — reauthorization and the of — and reform bill.  And so, don’t want to get into hypotheticals from here.  We are going to do everything that we can to get this done.,Obviously, the deadline for this is April 19th.,Q    Do you have an update on the Gaza hostage talks in Cairo?  And I think Jake is meeting with some hostage families today.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything on the Jake meeting with hostage families.  I would certainly refer you to the National Security Council.,As you know, there were reportings on the Di- — Director Burns being in Cairo over the weekend.  Certainly can confirm that for all of you.,I’m not going to get into details of those talks.  As you know, they’re incredibly sensitive.  And — and we’re doing everything — this administration is doing everything possible to broker a deal that secures the release of all hostages and leads to an immediate ceasefire.  And there is no — no higher priority for us at this time.,Q    And — and Israel’s withdrawal from parts of Gaza, what do you make of that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m just not going to get into the — Israel’s — Israel government op- — operations — military operations.  I’m just not going to get into.  I let them speak to it for themselves.,Go ahead, Mario.,Q    Yes, Jamie Dimon today, Morgan Chase’s CEO, said that — suggested that the LNG exports were political, the ban was — were — was political.  Does the administration have any response to that assertion at all?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, we want to be really clear about the facts here.  And the facts are: We announced a temporary pause on pending additional approvals of LNG,report,[export] licenses to evaluate the economic and climate impacts on consumers and communities.  I’ve mentioned this before — very recently, last week at the podium.,Meanwhile, record domestic oil and gas production is helping meet our immediate needs while we make the historic investment needed to transition to a clean energy economy.,The President has been very clear that climate crisis — that the climate is indeed — climate change is a crisis.  He’s going to do everything that he can to deal with this.  He’s — he’s been the most — yeah, he’s taken the most progressive, ambitious actions on dealing with climate change.  And we have to deal with the facts.  That’s what we have to deal with: the facts.,Q    On the student debt plan — the second student debt plan.  The — the earnings-to-borrow ratio that’s being applied to for-profit universities — if you took that ratio, it would also apply to almost 80 percent of undergraduate degrees, some HBCUs.  Why isn’t that being applied evenly?  It looks like you’re targeting the for-profit universities.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Just a couple of things.  Obviously, the Department of Education is going to be really squarely focused on this, but I’ll say a couple of things.,We’re committed to holding colleges accountable when they leave students with mountains of debt and without good job prospects.  That’s our commitment.,And so, we’ll be issuing proposed rules on the policies announced today in the coming months.  So, we’ll be able to address those specific questions in the coming months.  But obviously, the Department of Education is — is monitoring all of this as well.,Q    And does the White House have any response to what Senator Fetterman said this weekend about squatting?  He took a pretty firm stance against that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, I — you know, I’m always very careful on what — what congressional — congressional members say.  You know, I’m going to obviously let — let the senator speak for himself.,As I said before — I also spoke to this last week at the podium — it is critical that communities take action to address this issue in a way that works best for them.  While this is a local issue, it is important that we protect the rights of both property owners and also renters.,But I also want to be clear here: Anyone found guilty of a crime should be held accountable.  And that is something that we’ve been consistent about from here.,The bottom line is this: Everyone in every community in this country wants the same thing.  They want their families to be safe, and we want to see that.,Q    Just one follow-up on that.  Democrats are talking about a bill that would eliminate — would ban back- — criminal background checks for renters.  That would include convictions for squatting.  Does the administration support that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I haven’t seen that particular legislation — what Democrats are working on — so, I want to be super mindful and not comment on that.  Obviously, I need to check in with our Office of Leg Affairs.,But we’ve been very clear: Understanding this is a local issue, local government needs to address this, I don’t want to get ahead of — get ahead of where we might be on that.,Q    Karine, Steve asked about the withdrawal of troops in southern Gaza.  I just want to ask, is that something that the President and Netanyahu talked about last week?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything beyond the readout that we all shared with you.,Obviously, the purpose of that call last week was about protecting humanitarian aids who are in Gaza.  That was the purpose of that call.  And we have also said that Rafah operations was not part of that.  So, it was really focusing on that, what — what is — you know, what is Israel doing to protect humanitarian aid — aid workers, but also, six innocent civilians in Gaza, and that was the focus of the call.,It was a 30-minute call.  It was very direct.  And so, don’t have anything beyond what we’ve read out to all of you.,Q    On Ukraine.  I know you’ve been asked similar things.  But if — if the Democrats were to support Speaker Johnson, if you were to bring that to the floor, is that something — would you be opposed to Democrats kind of helping out Johnson there?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, that is — and you’re talking about as it relates to the — the national security —,Q    Yes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — supplemental?  Look, we’ve been always very clear, Democrat — you know, Leader — Leader Jeffries — he’s the Leader.  He — he will — he will determine what’s right for his demo- — for his caucus — obviously, the Democratic Caucus.  We’re not going to step into that.  We’ll let them figure out how they want to move forward.,Look, we’ve been very clear, and I said this at the top, I think even in my — in the first question that I got from Darlene: The national security supplemental — if we want to help Ukraine, if we want to keep our commitment to Ukraine as they are fighting for their freedom — the brave people of Ukraine fighting for their freedom, we got to get that national security supplemental done.  That is what is going to — we got to do our part.  We have to do our part.  And what we have seen in the past several weeks, several months is Ukraine is losing ground in the battlefield.  And that’s because of congressional inaction.,And so, we have to continue our support, as we’ve been supporting them for almost — more than two years now.  And they are fighting for their freedom, their democracy against Mr.  Putin’s aggression.,And so, look, we know what happens if we do not deal with tyranny, if we not — if we do not stop at a dictator.  We know how history has played out in the past.  And so, this is critical.  This is important.,If that — if Speaker Johnson were to put that supp- — national security supplemental on the — on the floor, we know that it would get overwhelming support.  But as it rel- — as it relates to Democrats and how they’re going to move forward, I would have to leave it to Leaders Sc- — Leader Jeffries.,Q    Just — just one more quick one on Trump and abortion.  I know the campaign put something out, but just on the policy position that he’s taking, any response?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I do.  So, obviously, don’t want to comment on 2024 election.  Going to be really mindful.,But I have a couple of things that I want to say here.  So, the only reason that — that extreme abortion bans are now in effect all over the country is because of the judges the previous President and Senate Republicans put in the courts.  The only reason that women are being denied lifesaving and even unrelated procedures and turned away from emergency rooms as a result of those bans is because of the judges the previous President and Senate Republicans have put in the courts.,The only reason that Republicans’ officials are able to take radical actions like banning IVF and criminalizing doctors for providing care is because of the judges the previous President and Senate Republicans put in the court.,When it comes to the fundamental freedoms at stake and the devastating healthcare effects that Republican officials’ extreme agenda mean for more and more American women every day, we need to be clear-eyed here.,Just look at the extreme law about to go into effect in Florida, as one in three women live in states with bans — with bans.,Just look at the budget.  Look at the budget 80 percent of House Republicans put out that bans abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest.,The President is absolutely clear, his administration — the Biden-Harris administration — has been very clear: We need to restore the protections of Roe, and that’s what we’re going to continue to fight for.,Q    Karine, the Vatican, today, put out a new document that states gender-affirming operations risk, quote, “threatening the unique dignity the person has received from the moment of conception,” and also denounces attempts to obscure, quote, “the sexual difference between man and woman.”,Obviously, the President is a devout Catholic.  I’m wondering if he has seen that document and if he has any comments on it.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I — I’ll say this: So, we are pleased to see that the document you just mentioned, Tyler, further the Vatican’s call to ensure that LGBTQ+ are protected from violence and imprisonment around the world.,However, the President will continue to be an advocate for the rights, safety, and dignity of the LGBTQ+ community, including transgender people, here in the U.S. — and not just here in the U.S. but also around the world.,And I just don’t have anything else to add.,Q    What about the — what about the more specific comments about gender theory and — and transgender individuals?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I’m going to be really careful and — and the President’s role to — to litigate internal church policy.  It’s not — that’s not his role.  So, I’m going to be super careful there.,But I can speak to the President’s stance, and he’s always been very clear on the importance of protecting — or having protections for the transgender community and the broader LGBTQ+ community.  And that’s been very clear since day one of his administration.,Q    And just one more on student debt.  Does — the President’s previous attempts to cancel student debt have been struck down by the courts.  What is the level of confidence within the administration about the ability to — to go forward with the plan that he’s going to lay out in more detail today?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, we know that Republicans’ officials, obviously, in the past, have done everything that they can to oppose the President’s — the President’s effort to give Americans — millions of Americans a little breathing room.,So, while we can’t prevent them from — from filing lawsuits against this plan, the President will never stop fighting on behalf of borrowers, no matter how many times Republicans try to stop them.,You know, we — as I just stated at the top in answering your question, we know what Republicans are going to do.  We can’t stop them from that.  But it’s also not going to stop the President on acting and taking action like he’s doing today.,Q    And just one more quick one.  Did the President — you said the President called the coach of South Carolina.  Did he watch any of the game last night?  And did he invite them to the White House?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’ll have more to share.  We’ll have more to share on — on a potential visit to the White House.  As you know, that is a common — that is a common — common event for the champions to come to the White House.  So, we’ll certainly have more to share.,I have not had a second to ask him if he was able to watch the game last night, so I don’t have anything to share on that.,Q    One quick follow-up.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q    Why is the —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Which — which follow-up?  (Laughs.),Q    I’m going back to the eclipse.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay, okay, okay.  (Laughter.),Q    Why is the President traveling today?  Did he not want to be at the White House for this, you know, big moment?  I mean, during the last eclipse, President Trump was at the White House and watched from the balcony.  So, just —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We all saw that moment, yes.,Q    Just wondering if this current president —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We all know that moment.  And, hopefully, you saw the President’s video on the eclipse.,Look, we know — we know how exciting this is.  We get it.  We know that people are going to want to watch it, obviously.  And I said this multiple times already: We want them to do it safely, put some — the — your protective eyewear on to do this.,Look, but student loans matter — right? — giving — giving Americans student loan relief also matters, right?,Q    True, but you could talk about student loans any day of the week.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  (Laughs.),Q    The eclipse only comes around, you know, once every 40 years.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, I know.  I know.,But, you know, the President has a different schedule.  And the schedule certainly is — is focused on — on what he’s doing on behalf of the American people.,And, look, you know, what he announced today con- — and as — as it’s obviously also connected to other announcement that he’s — he’s made on — on student — on student debt relief — is going to help at least 30 million Americans across the country.  That matters.,And I think when we go to Madison, Wisconsin, which the President is — is really looking forward to do and having — and him laying out what he’s — what he’s announcing, I think folks there are going to be excited to hear about that too.,And so, look, it’s an exciting day.  Yes, there’s an eclipse.  But, you know, the President — it’s not going to stop the President from traveling and being — going directly to the American people and talking about a plan that he pro- — he promised that he would deliver on — deliver on, even though Republican officials have tried to stop it.,Q    Can I ask you about the articles of impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas and the trial this week?  House Republicans clearly believe that he violated the law there.  Do you all take this as a sign that some law has been violated or just that it’s a — a representation of a frustration with border policies?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple of things.  And I’ve talk- — I’ve spoken to this many times before.  Obviously, this is not their first attempt.,And as the President has said, “History will not look kindly on House Republicans for this blatant act of unconstitutional partnership.”  This impeachment stunt already failed once on the — on a bipartisan vote.  And it drew bipartisan opposition again in February, as I know you’re tracking.,Instead of wasting time on these kinds of political games, Republicans should — should want Congress to deliver more resources and stronger border security.  We talked about that.  There is a bipartisan border security proposal that we were able to ha- — make happen in the Senate, as you all know.  That took a couple of months.  And the former President told Republicans to reject it.,Hopefully, they will do the right thing and be where majority of Americans are when it comes to the immigration system and fi- — fixing — fixing that — a system that’s been broken for decades.,So, if — this is not what the American people want or expect from their leaders.  They want us to deliver on real, real solutions — solving problems that they have — including, as I just mentioned, the border security.,Q    Is the administration still considering executive actions at this point?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, I’ve also been very clear about this, and I think the President has been as well: This administration has been — the only real solution, we believe, in dealing with the border challenges that we’re seeing and — and fixing the immigration system, again, that’s been broken for decades is moving forward with this border security proposal.,Again, I stated this at the top; I’ll state it again.  You’ve got the Border Patrol union supporting this; you have the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  It was done in a bipartisan way — the negotiation — coming out of the Senate.  You know, we believe this is the way to move forward.,And it would be, yes, tough but also fair.  And it would be the first — I think the first — the first legislation, if it were to get through and the President were to sign it, that we have seen in some time.,And so, a majority of Americans care about this.  Let’s get to work.  Congress should get to work and get this done.,Q    If it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen, though, before the end of — before the end of President Biden’s first term, is it something that the administration thinks is important enough to move on unilaterally?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, the President has taken so many actions over the last three years.  And he started off putting forth his own — his own proposal — a comprehensive immigration proposal the first day — first day that he walked in — the first piece of legislation that he wanted to move.  And three and a half — three — three years — more than three years, Republicans got in the way at every turn.  Every turn, they got in the way of getting things done.,And so, we finally came to the end of the — end of last year, had a conversation — Republicans in the Senate, Democrats in the Senate — to get this done.  I mean, that’s pretty impressive to be able to come out with a bipartisan proposal.,The former President got in the way and told — and told Republicans to reject it because it’s going to help Biden — I mean, you all reported that — and hurt him.  And that’s unfortunate.,So, look, there’s been many times where we’ve been told that we’re not going to get things done in a bipartisan way, and we’ve been able to do that in the past three years.  So, that’s not going to stop us.,We’re going to continue to call on Republicans to — to — for them to reject what the former President told them on not doing — on not moving on this — and to move on this on behalf of no politics, not partisanship, but on behalf of the American people.,All right?  Thanks, everybody.,Q    Thank you.,12:47 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Madison Area Technical College,Madison, Wisconsin,1:26 P.M. CDT,THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Wisconsin.  (Applause.)  Hello, hello, hello.  Please, have a seat if there is — you have one.  (Laughter.),Gov, thank you.  Thank you for that nice introduction.,And thank you, Ashley, for tha- — introducing me and sharing your story.  I, like an awful lot of people in this audience had — was the first in my family to go to college and watched my dad struggle to help me get there and get all the kids there.  And it wasn’t easy.,But, you know, I ask the rhetorical question: How can we be the leading country in the world without the best education system in the world and access to it?,You and Sam are from rural Wisconsin, first in your families to go to college — life partners, business partners, hardworking, paying off your loans — only to see your dreams being crushed by student debt.,But now, thanks to what we’re doing, that student debt is no longer holding you back.  (Applause.),With this new freedom, you started your own business that helps women and minority-owned businesses right here in Wisconsin.  (Applause.),That’s what this is all about.  I think we all, in this room, share one goal: Give everybody a fair shot — just a shot — freedom to chase their dreams.,You know, you’ve got some of the great leaders of Wisconsin here as well.  And I mean that sincerely.  I think Tony knows this: Your governor — I think he’s one of the best governors in the United States.  (Applause.)  And not just — you really are, Tony.  And what progress we’ve made, and we’ve made a lot, is in no small part because of Tony.  (Applause.),And the bad news for Tony is, we’ve become friends.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.),And, Mark, thank you, Representative.  Thanks for the passport to get into the district.  I appreciate it.  You’re doing a hell of a job.,And Madison Mayor, thank you — where is she?  There you are.  Stand up.  (Applause.)  I get instructions from my wife, who’s a schoolteacher.  She said, “Make sure you say hello to the mayor.  I really like being with her.”  Thank you, Mayor, for taking care of her.  (Applause.),And the state and local [and] Tribal leaders here today, thanks for making it available.  (Applause.)  Where are you?  There you — stand up, Chief.  Thank you.  (Applause.),And, by the way, it’s Indian Nations.,And while she couldn’t be here, I’m always grateful for one of the best senators in the United States Senate, Tammy Baldwin.  (Applause.)  She really is.  She’s a great partner on education, infrastructure, buy American, and so much more.  She’s done so much.,And when Kamala and I ran this led in — in this lead county, we made a commitment to fix our broken student loan system.  Because while a college degree still is a ticket to the middle class, that ticket is becoming much too expensive — much too expensive.,In fact, things are a lot different from when college tuition was more affordable and borrowing for college was — repaying those loans was re- — more reasonable.,Today, too many Americans, especially young people, are saddled with unsustainable debts in exchange for a college degree.  The ability for working- and middle-class folks to repay their student loans has become so burdensome that a lot can’t repay it for even decades after being in school.  And I mean that sincerely.  Many of you know that, sitting in front of me.  Even when they have worked hard and pay their student loans, their debt increases, not diminishes.,Too many people feel the strain and stress, wondering if they’re going to — can get married, have their first child, start a family, because, even if they get by, they still have this crushing, crushing debt.,That’s not — you know, it’s not just a drag on them, it’s a drag on our local economies.  It’s a rag on — no, it really is.  It’s a drag on the economies when you can’t afford to buy a home, start that small business, chase that career that you’ve been dreaming about for a long time.,That’s why, early in my term, I announced a major plan to provide more than 40 million working- and middle-class Americans student debt relief.  Tens of millions — (applause) — tens of millions of people’s debt was literally about to get canceled, but then some of my Republican friends and elected officials and special interests sued us, and the Supreme Court blocked us.,But that didn’t —,AUDIENCE:  Booo —,THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that didn’t stop us.  No, I mean it sincerely.  We continue to find alternative paths to reduce student debt payments — (applause) — that are not challengeable.,And altogether, my administration has taken the most significant action to provide student debt relief ever in the history of this country.  (Applause.)  We started by fixing two existing programs to get more people the student debt relief than their — that they were entitled to.,First, we fixed what was called the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which was designed — (applause) — to make sure those in public service — schoolteachers, police officers, firefighters, social workers, faith leaders, public servants — you get the student loan forgiven in 10 years if they’ve made their payments for those first 10 years.  And after 10 years, in the student — in public service, they would have their loan forgiven.,When I took office, 7,000 public,service,[servants] had their debt — 7,000 had their debts forgiven.  But the program wasn’t wor- — working very well, so I called in the Department of Education and other departments and said, “We got to fix this and fix it now.”  Thanks to our reforms, nearly 900,000 have had their debts forgiven — (applause) — including 16,400 right here in Wisconsin — right here in Wisconsin.  (Applause.),Second, we turned what’s called an income-driven repayment program, which I’ve renamed the SAVE program — the most affordable repayment plan ever.,Before I took office, student borrowers had to pay 10 percent of their discretionary income on a monthly basis from what they borrowed — 10 percent discretionary income.  That’s the income after you pay necessities like housing and food.  A lot of people didn’t have the means to pay 10 percent, so I was able to (inaudible) my authority to have the department cut that to 5 percent for undergraduate loans.  (Applause.),Now, that means no one with undergraduate loans, whether a community college or a four-year college, would have to pay more than 5 percent of their discretionary income to repay those loans starting in July — starting in July of this year.,And for millions of borrowers who make less than $32,000 a year now after they’re out, their monthly student payments will be dropped to zero as long as they’re that — (applause) — really.,And already, close to 8 million Americans have enr- — had enrolled in the SAVE Plan, including 135,000 here in Wisconsin.  (Applause.),Because of our reforms, 25,000 people a month nationwide have been receiving letters from me about their debt they had for four years — for all those years is finally going to be forgiven.  But I’m not stopping here.,Today, I’m proud to announce five major actions to continue to relieve student debt for more than 30 million Americans since this — I started my administration.,First, my administration will propose a new rule to cancel up to $20,000 in runaway interest for any borrower that owes more now — (applause) — owes more now than when they started paying the loan.  (Applause.)  That make — it’s a big difference.,And for low- and middle-class families enrolled in my SAVE program, we’ll cancel all of your interest — all of your interest.  (Applause.),And second, we plan to cancel student debt for borrowers who still owe student loans even though they started repaying them more than two decades ago.,Folks, third, we plan to cancel debt for about 2 million borrowers who would be eligible for debt forgiveness through the SAVE program, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or other debt-canceling programs but are not enrolled in these programs.  Some of you are only finding out after the fact, you’re — as you’re a teacher, a firefighter, a cop, that you qualify, but you just didn’t know about it before.  And now people are — but you’re eligible no matter how long it’s been — you’ve been out of the program.,Fourth, we plan to cancel debt for borrowers who the Department of Education determines were cheated by universities that left students with unaffordable loans and delivered little in benefits to students.  (Applause.),And you know — you know one of those — you know one of those colleges was closed.  I won’t mention it.  (Laughter.),And, finally, the Department of Education will propose a new rule to cancel student debt for Americans facing financial hardships, from childcare to healthcare,,to,[that] prevent them from paying back their loans.,And over the coming months, the Department of Education will propose and then implement these plans.,And starting this fall, we plan to deliver up to $20,000 in interest relief to over 20 million borrowers and full forgiveness for millions more.  (Applause.),I can tell by the looks on some of your faces this relief — it’s not news to you all.  Because this relief can be life-changing — life-changing, just as you heard from Ashley.,Folks, I will never stop [fighting] to deliver student debt relief,on,[to] hardworking Americans.  And it’s only in the interest of America that we do it.  And, again, it’s for the good of our economy, that’s growing stronger and stronger — and it is.,By freeing millions of Americans from this crushing debt of student debt, it means they can finally get on with their lives instead of being put — their lives being put on hold.,That’s why every American making student loan payments should go to StudentAid.Gov — StudentAid.Gov to learn more about these plans and see if you’re — if — if any of them fit for you.,Look, that’s not all.  People say to me, “It’s great you’re helping people [get] into college.  How about all those hardworking people who grew up and had no opportunity to go to college?”,I get it.  That’s the neighborhood I come from.,That’s why a big part of my economic agenda is investing in all Americans, whether you attend college or not.,We’re expanding career and technical education at high schools — we — and think how many of these shop programs have been dropped, people not knowing whether they want to work with their hands, th- — not about being able to get started — to provide pathways to good middle-class jobs without college.,My Labor Department is investing $200 million in grants for registered apprenticeship programs around the country — (applause) — so for- — folks can learn a skilled trade.,And, by the way, parenthetically, you know all the money in the CHIPS program I put together?  Well, guess what?  It’s going to invest over $50 billion in new programs — new ability to make these chips here in America.  And in those “fabs” they call them, guess what?  You know what the average salary is?  A hundred and ten thousand dollars a year, and you don’t need a college degree — (applause) — but you need a skill.,Programs like the one that — taught right here at Madison Technical College that lead to good-paying jobs in high-growth fields — in clean energy, healthcare, and technology.,These apprenticeship programs are four and five years before you qualify to have a license.  I love people saying, “Well, why are you — why are you so pro-union, pro-labor?”,AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Wooo!,THE PRESIDENT:  The — well — (applause) — no — a lot of people think you can walk up and say, “I want to be an electrician,” and you’re an electrician.  Five years of apprenticeship.  It’s like going to college.  Five years.,I also want to make — and I’ve been pushing this, and if I’m reelected, I’m going to push it hard; we’re going to get it done next time — is I want to make community college tuition free — (applause) — so you won’t need loans at all.  It’ll cut in half the cost of going to college.,If we do this, the economic gains will far outweigh the cost.  And that’s not hyperbole; that’s the truth.,This is in addition to the historic investments we’re making to moderfiz- — modernize our infrastructure: roads, bridges, high-speed Internet, clean — clean water for every American.  We need more qualified people doing this work to bring back manufacturing — back to America, to build new factories in your communities.,And I’m investing in the American agenda.  We expect to create millions of jobs over the next decade.  We’ve already created over 15 million new jobs — 15 million new jobs.  (Applause.)  And a significant number of these do not require a college degree, including across Wisconsin.,Let me close with this.  My dad used to say — and I’m — it’s not hyperbole.  My dad was a hardworking guy.  He re- — well-read man, got into college.  He’s from Bal- — they say — everybody thinks it’s “Baltimore.”  It’s,Baltimore,.  (Pronounced in an accent.)  (Laughter.),He was from Baltimore.  He — and he — he got into college to go to Johns Hopkins.  I didn’t know that until after he had passed away.  But it was during the war — just prior to the war.  He was working in the shipyard.  And he couldn’t go.,But he used to always — he had this phrase.  He’d say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect.  It’s about having a place in the community where you, in fact, are — feel like you belong.  It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’”,That’s what we’re doing.  We’re giving people a chance to make it — not a guarantee, just a chance to make it.  And that’s why I’ve never been more optimistic about our future.,We just have to remember who we are.  We are the United States of America.  And there’s nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together — nothing, nothing, nothing.  (Applause.),May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.,Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.),1:40 P.M.

He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action on these steps.

He laid out his vision for a future where we make the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share while protecting and strengthening these bedrock programs that hardworking Americans pay into their entire working lives.,Less than two weeks later, the Republican Study Committee—which speaks for 80% of House Republicans and 100% of their leadership—released an extreme budget that takes direct aim at,Medicare and Social Security,. Their plan:,Congressional Republicans are demanding these reckless cuts in order to make room for another $5.5 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations—including by providing massive tax cuts for billionaire investors, repealing President Biden’s minimum tax on billion-dollar corporations, and weakening the IRS’s ability to make wealthy tax cheats pay the taxes they owe.,At the same time, the Republican Study Committee budget would also require a roughly 31% cut to non-defense discretionary spending, which would force devastating cuts to countless programs that hardworking Americans count on. What would these cuts mean for seniors and people with disabilities who call for assistance with their Social Security and Medicare?,Below is a state-by-state breakdown showing how many Americans would face longer wait times when calling for assistance with Medicare and Social Security under the Republican Study Committee budget:,This analysis assumes an across-the-board reduction of roughly 31% compared to the currently enacted FY 2024 levels for non-defense discretionary (NDD) accounts. This aligns with the Republican Study Committee Budget, which would cut NDD base funding to $534 billion in FY 2025, a roughly 31% reduction from the funding provided in the enacted FY 2024 bills.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",04-04-24,FACT SHEET: Extreme House Republican Plan Would Cut Medicare and Social Security While Slashing Taxes for Big Corporations and the Wealthy,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/04/fact-sheet-extreme-house-republican-plan-would-cut-medicare-and-social-security-while-slashing-taxes-for-big-corporations-and-the-wealthy/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As President Biden,said,when this legislation was enacted: “No one should have to live in constant fear for their life or being subjected to violence and discrimination. It is wrong.”,As directed by President Biden, the United States continues to assess implications of the AHA on all aspects of U.S. engagement with the Government of Uganda and has,taken significant actions,thus far. The United States will continue to hold accountable individuals and entities that perpetrate human rights abuses in Uganda, both unilaterally and with partners around the world.,Yesterday’s ruling is a missed opportunity for Uganda—not only to uphold the human rights of all Ugandans, but also to reaffirm the importance of dignity, compassion, and tolerance for all. The United States remains committed to the Ugandan people and has the greatest respect for Uganda’s human rights defenders that are bravely fighting for the rights of all.

He was in Memphis to march with sanitation workers rightly demanding safer working conditions, fairer wages, and basic dignity as part of the larger quest to make real the promise of America for all Americans.,But then, an extremist – armed with a rifle in his hands and fueled by the poison of white supremacy in his heart – shot and killed a great American who loved his country so deeply to make it better – even greater – even when it didn’t always love him back. Dr. King and generations of foot soldiers known and unknown embody a patriotism that continues to inspire generations of Americans, including me.,Dr. King is one of my political heroes. I was just out of law school when my hometown of Wilmington, Delaware was among the many cities engulfed in turmoil in the wake of his assassination. His unfinished mission inspired me to leave a prestigious law firm to become a public defender and begin a career in public service.,Since then, I’ve seen the push and pull and progress and setback on everything he stood for from voting rights to jobs and justice for all Americans. I’ve had the greatest honor to serve as Vice President to the first Black President and now President with the first woman Vice President, as we carry forward his vision of a beloved community.,But on this day, and in this time, we all do well to remember another essential lesson about Dr. King’s life and legacy. All Americans – regardless of party or background – should be able to reject political violence and hate-fueled violence in any form. We must condemn it, not condone it. We must confront it, not whitewash it. As we do, we must teach history and make history, not erase history. We must choose community over chaos.,Jill and I send our love to the entire King family. We especially keep in our hearts the legacy of Mrs. Coretta Scott King, who we all miss dearly and who did so much in her own right to redeem the soul of our nation.,May God bless Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",04-04-24,"Statement from President Joe Biden On the 56th Anniversary of theAssassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/04/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-56th-anniversary-of-theassassination-of-dr-martin-luther-king-jr/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,East Room,5:29 P.M. EDT,THE PRESIDENT: Well, Your Eminence, thank you very much.,I should start by saying the only reason I’m able to stand here is because of the Greek community. That’s not hyperbole.,I won my election as a 29-year-old senator — I know I’m only about 40 now, but — (laughter) — a 29-year-old senator by 3,100 votes — as my sister, Valerie, who’s here, will tell you — managed my campaign.,And as we were — you always look, in Delaware, from — you work politically from south to north. And I was coming up from Delmar, Delaware, checking all the polling stations on Election Day in — that November in ‘72. And I got across what they call the Canal — the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal. We — it’s the C&D Canal, the Chesapeake and Dela- — we call it the other way around.,And I was losing. And I got into Wilmington, and one of the — please move all that back, by the way.,One of the things that I — I learned early on was that I had a very close relationship with the Greek American community — for real — in the heart and — I mean, real — and the church there as well.,And I think, if there were — I forget the exact number of votes, but I think every Greek American in Delaware voted for me because they — (laughter) — no, no, no, no, no — (applause).,By the way, as some of the Delawareans would tell you, that’s where I acquired a nickname I’m very proud of: I am Joe “Biden-opoulos.” (Laughter and applause.) That’s the nickname I got.,So, Your Eminence, thank you for that — that introduction and for reminding us of the core values that unite Greece and America and so many other people around the world.,Welcome to the White House, everybody. This is your house, and you’re one of the reasons why, as I said, I’m here and why this house is here.,Today, we celebrate 203 years of Greek independence — 203 years. And we celebrate the ties of friendship and family between Greece and the United States that stretch back even longer than that.,Archbishop, the folks in this room embody those ties. We have proud Greek Americans here in the worlds of science, journalism, academia, finance, as well as small-business owners, religious leaders, public servants from all across America.,And together — together, you truly embody the breadth of the contributions that the Greek American community delivers every day for their country in communities all across the country and all across the nation.,I want to make — I want to welcome Eleni, who is here. She is the Lieutenant Governor of California. (Applause.) But before that, she was an ambassador in the Biden-Obama — the O-Biden — (laughter) — the — the Obama-Biden administration. (Laughter.) And she to- — anybody who could take care of Hungary in those days can handle anything. (Laughter.) But you’ve been a great friend for many years, and I thank you.,And welcome to the ambassadors from Greece and Cyprus, who are here. Raise your hands, guys. I don’t know where you are out there.,There you are. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you.,As well as the United States’ Ambassador to Greece, an old friend of mine — I asked him to be the ambassador, and I hope he forgives me, but he’s doing a great job — George Tsunis.,George Tsunis, where are you? (Applause.) There you are, George.,And if you’ll allow me to name a few additional friends here today. Now, look, I went to University of Dela- — everybody tells me the great schools they went to. All my kids went to Penn and Georgetown and all these other — they — they didn’t go to the really great school. I went to the University of Delaware. (Laughter.) And the president of the University of Delaware happens to be a Greek American standing right in front of me here. (Applause.),The president of the University of Delaware, Dennis Assanis, and Eleni, who is really the president, I think, his wife. (Laughs.) Mr. President, you’re making me very proud and the university very proud.,And, look, I see some old friends out there: Andy and Mike Manatos. Guys, you — you go back a long way with me. You’re one of the reasons why I’m here, for real.,This is not hyperbole. I’m not exaggerating any of this. It’s the reason why I got here.,And, by the way, it’s though he’s not here to- — although he’s not here today, I just got off the phone with an old friend of mine, celebrating his birthday everywh- — elsewhere with his grandchildren, my friend, Father Alex. He sends all his love. (Applause.) And he is my friend — from the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.,And, by the way, I have a — and he and I have traveled the country and the world together, including in Greece. And on more than one occasion, I visited His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who was a great, great friend and a great, great man.,Remember he was having a little trouble being held in another country? We made it clear that if he wasn’t taken care of quickly, we may have a problem w- — the United States.,And two years ago, I was very proud to give Father Alex, by the way, the Medal — the Presidential Medal of Freedom.,You know — (applause) — my friends, to be very blunt about it, my sister and I, all year, look forward to this reception. And some of you know, the fact is that we’re in a situation where I have found lifelong friends in this audience, mentors in this,country,[community]. I’ve found inspiration in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, which has been a clarion voice for social justice for decades.,You know, I’m an Irish American. I know that shocks you all. (Laughter.) But we have — I’ve felt a deep kinship with the Greek American community. So many grandparents, so many great-grandparents started out in America just — with just the clothes on their back, like my ancestors did, and went on to build good lives for themselves and, even more importantly, good futures for their families.,And so many of the values I grew up with, the values my Greek American friends grew up with as well, like treating everyone with dignity. My dad used to say, “You know, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’”,Like treating everyone with dignity, no matter who they are; working hard, dreaming big, never forgetting where you come from, and always holding on to the pride — pride in your family, in your community, your heritage, and, above all, pride in the great country we share together.,That pride is felt by so many immigrant communities all across America. And we celebrate that today.,Today is about friendship. Aristotle said, “A friend is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.” “A friend is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.” And that’s what we are: We’re friends.,To me, that captures the relationship between Greece and the United States. I believe the soul is the breath, the life, the essence of who we are. The soul is what makes us “us,” in my view.,America is the only country on Earth built on an idea. Every other country is based on ethnicity, geography, religion, and other attributes. But America is based on a simple idea, for real.,We’re not based on geog- — we’re based on an idea: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain in- — inalienable rights,” et cetera — you know, that we’re all entitled to be treated with decency and dignity, respect throughout our lives. And democracy must always be defended because it’s the vehicle that allows it all to happen — makes all this possible.,And you all know where that idea came from — democracy, where it was born: in Greece, a millennia ago, where some of the greatest thinkers in the world’s history conceived the notion of “We the People.” That’s where it came from. “We the People” — “demos” in democracy — can and should control our own destiny.,In my view, it’s the precious gift the Greeks — Greece has given the world. And that gift can give rise to our nation — it gave rise to it.,America’s Founding Fathers studied ancient Greek thinkers and leaders. Our revolution in 1776 was inspired — literally, not figuratively — inspired by their ideas. I know we always say this, but I wonder whether we really fully, totally appreciate what it was.,Forty-five years after that, Greek patriots fought for their own independence, galvanized by America’s quest for liberty. And that’s why the anniversary of Greece’s in- — Greek’s independence is a special day in America as well.,Our nations are connected. We have shared values, shared aspirations, and shared belief in all that is possible.,I was once asked by Xi Jinping in — I traveled 17,000 miles with him in Tibet- — I was on the Tibetan Plateau. And he looked at me, and he said to me, “Can you define America?” And I could say the same thing if he asked me to define Greece. I said, “Yes, one word,” — and I mean this sincerely; it’s reg- — it’s recorded. I said, “One word: possibilities.” “Possibilities.”,We believe anything is possible. When “We the People” come together for the common good, the bonds between us are rooted in our history. But they’re very much alive today. In this very room, together, we’re keeping those bonds alive.,The people of Greece, the people of the United States did not just inherit democracy. We have to be its defenders. It has to be, every generation, championed. We must be its champion. And that’s as important today as it’s ever been, and that’s not hyperbole.,So, I want to thank you all for being here to celebrate liberty. And I want to thank you for your commitment, making it real, in our time, the ideals that sparked our two nations’ struggle for independence more than 200 years ago.,And may both Greece and the United States continue to lift high the lamp of democracy so we can always serve as the beacon of hope to the world.,So, folks, happy Greek Independence Day. And welcome to your house.,Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.),5:40 P.M.

But it didn’t happen by accident, nor was it inevitable. Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow Allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression—knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer, when we do.,We saw this during the Cold War, as we stood united against the forces of Soviet totalitarianism. We saw it again when America was attacked on September 11, 2001 and our Allies invoked NATO Article 5—an attack against one, is an attack against all—for the first and only time in history. And we’ve seen it over the last two years, as Allies have stepped up to support the brave people of Ukraine in the face of Russia’s vicious invasion—the largest war in Europe since World War II.,Today, NATO is larger, stronger, and more determined than ever before. We’ve added Finland and Sweden to the Alliance—two democracies, with two highly capable militaries. Over the past three years, our NATO Allies have increased their own annual defense spending by almost $80 billion. As our adversaries have plotted to break our remarkable unity, our democracies have stood unwavering. And this July, the United States will host a Washington NATO Summit—bringing together our Allies to modernize our defense and deterrence.,Now, like generations before us, we must choose to protect this progress and build on it. We must remember that the sacred commitment we make to our Allies—to defend every inch of NATO territory—makes us safer too, and gives the United States a bulwark of security unrivaled by any other nation in the world. And like our predecessors, we must ask ourselves what can we do—what must we do—to create a more peaceful future.,75 years ago today—after signing the treaty that brought NATO into existence—President Harry Truman said: “If there is anything certain today, if there is anything inevitable in the future, it is the will of the people of the world for freedom and for peace.” I believe that will is stronger today than ever before—and in the years ahead, I know we’ll prove it.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",04-04-24,Statement from President Joe Biden on NATO’s 75th Anniversary,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/04/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-natos-75th-anniversary/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arizona, stationed on Battleship Row at Pearl Harbor, Hawai’i. His job was quartermaster, assisting with the battleship’s navigation. He had just turned 20 years old.,When Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor began that morning, the Arizona was hit by several armor-piercing bombs. One hit the ship’s magazine, where more than a million pounds of gunpowder were stored. The battleship exploded.,Lou, miraculously, was uninjured. He quickly got to work helping survivors, and he spent the next several days helping to put out fires and recover bodies. In the end, 1,177 officers and crewmen of the U.S.S. Arizona were killed. Fewer than 100 of the people on board that day survived.,Lou Conter’s service to his country didn’t end there. He became a Naval pilot, flying hundreds of combat missions in World War II and dozens in the Korean War. He also became the Navy’s very first SERE officer, training airmen in critical skills – Survive, Evade, Resist, and Escape – in case they were shot down or captured. By the time he retired from the military, he had earned the rank of lieutenant commander. And he never forgot all the brave men he served with on board the Arizona. Until he was nearly 100 years old, he attended annual memorial services at Pearl Harbor.,When Lou passed away on Monday at the age of 102, America said farewell to the last known survivor of the U.S.S. Arizona.,The women and men who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces are patriots in the highest sense. Like Lou, they risk their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans. Like Lou, they bravely undertake dangerous missions to defend our nation’s freedom and future. Like Lou, they believe deeply in their duty to their country and their fellow service members and will go to the ends of the earth to fulfill that duty. Our nation owes them all a debt of gratitude we can never repay.,Today, our hearts are with Lou Conter’s family and friends, and all those he served with over the years, including his shipmates on the U.S.S.

White House officials thanked the legislators for their leadership in paving the way on this important issue and highlighted the Administration’s continued commitment to this work.,This convening comes as the Administration marks “Month of Action on Care” in April, which the President designated,Care Workers Recognition Month,last year when he signed the historic,Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers,.  It also follows the release of President Biden’s FY 2025 Budget, which proposes a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program to ensure that all workers can take the time they need to bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one’s military deployment; find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or grieve the death of a loved one.  The Administration applauds the thirteen states and the District of Columbia that have passed paid leave laws, and continues to call for a national paid family and medical leave program.,Participating state leaders included:,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",02-04-24,Readout of White House State Legislative Convening on Paid Family and Medical Leave,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/02/readout-of-white-house-state-legislative-convening-on-paid-family-and-medical-leave/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,James S. Brady Press Briefing Room,2:10 P.M. EDT,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon.,Q Good afternoon.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I have just a couple things at the top, and then we’ll — we’ll get going.,So, tomorrow, as you all know, the President is going to be traveling to Baltimore, where he will receive an operational update on response efforts from the unified command. Leaders from the Coast Guard and Army Co- — and the Army Corps of Engineers will share updates on the assistance they are providing to state officials in surveying and removing the wreckage in the channel and allowing the Port of Baltimore to reopen as soon as humanly possible.,The President will be joined by Governor Moore and other Maryland and Baltimore-area elected officials. He’ll also be joined by Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.,As we all know, six individuals tragically lost their lives when the Francis Scott,King,[Key] Bridge collapsed last week. They were hard workers, laboring in the middle of the night to repair potholes on a bridge that tens of thousands of travelers crossed every day. The President will meet with loved ones of those individuals during his trip tomorrow.,The President is continuing to lead a whole-of-government approach in responding to the bridge collapse. As the President said within hours of the collapse, this administration will be with the people of Baltimore every step of the way.,SBA Administrator Guzman is in Baltimore today as part of this administration’s efforts to support small businesses in need.,I also want to share a very big announcement that the Vice President and the — EPA Administrator Regan made today in Charlotte, North Carolina. They announced a $20 billion — 20 — $20 billion in awards to expand access to clean energy, tackle the climate crisis, improve air quality, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs.,This investment through the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will stand up a national network that will finance tens of thousands of climate and clean energy projects across America.,At least 70 percent of these funds will be invested in low-income and disadvantaged communities. This makes the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund the single-largest non-tax investment in the Inflation Reduction Act to build a clean energy economy while benefiting communities that have historically been left behind.,And finally, finally, finally, I want to briefly preview the President’s schedule next week.,On Monday, we — he will travel to Madison, Wisconsin, and discuss how he is lowering costs for Americans.,Later in the week, the President and the First Lady will host the Prime Minister of Japan and his wife for an official visit to the United States. This will include a state dinner on Wednesday, April 10th.,The visit will underscore the enduring strength of our alliance, the unwavering U.S. commitment to Japan, and Japan’s increasing global leadership role.,On Thursday, April 11th, President Biden will host,Prime Minister,[President] Marcos of the Philippines, Prime Minister Kishida of Japan at the White House for the first trilateral U.S.-Japan-Philippines leaders’ summit.,In addition, President Biden will host President Marcos for a meeting at the White House on April 11th to review the historic momentum in U.S.-Philippines relations.,Thank you for your patience. With that, the Admiral is here to talk about the President’s call with Prime Minister Netanyahu and any updates that we have in the Middle East.,Admiral.,MR. KIRBY: Thank you very much.,Good afternoon, everybody.,Q Good afternoon.,MR. KIRBY: Obviously, a busy day here. I do want to take a moment just at the start to recognize the 75th anniversary of the NATO Alliance, the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And you all saw the statement from the President earlier today celebrating this historic milestone.,Now, for 75 years, the NATO Alliance has stood together for freedom and against aggression, provided an unrivaled bulwark of security that has helped protect the American people. And during that time, our NATO Allies have come to our aid in our time of need, with NATO forces serving alongside ours in Afghanistan.,Today, NATO is larger, stronger, it’s more relevant than ever before thanks in no small part to the President’s leadership. And we look forward to building on all that progress in July when we host our 31 NATO Allies here in Washington, D.C., for the next NATO Summit.,Now, as I’m sure you’re all aware, the President had a chance to speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu earlier today. On that phone call, the President emphasized that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation in Gaza are unacceptable.,He made clear the need for Israel to announce and to implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers.,He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action on these steps.,He underscored that an immediate ceasefire is essential to stabilize and improve the humanitarian situation and to protect innocent civilians. And he urged the Prime Minister to empower his negotiators to conclude a deal without delay to bring the hostages home.,The two leaders also discussed public Iranian threats against Israel and the Israeli people. President Biden made clear that the United States strongly supports Israel in the face of those threats.,That’s all I have.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Zeke.,Q Thanks, John. First, on that last piece there. You said — you have said it from this podium several times that that — the — Hamas was the obstacle to getting some sort of ceasefire deal. Calling on the Israelis to empower the negotiators suggests that has changed. Has the U.S. assessment of Israeli willingness to reach a ceasefire deal changed in the last several weeks?,MR. KIRBY: No. It — look, it takes — it takes active participation and the negotiation of both sides here. And — and that’s what the President is urging. He’s certainly, in the call with Netanyahu, urging that — that the Prime Minister empower his team to the maximum extent possible to see if we can get this deal in place.,Q And then just on the substance of the real news from the President’s statement there, saying that he’s going to condition future U.S. support for this — for Israeli — the Israeli operation in Gaza on what Israel does. First off, what is at stake? What would be potentially cut off from Israel for use in this war if the — if he doesn’t change course?,And second, what do you want specifically to see from Israel were — to do to protect civilians and humanitarian aid workers?,MR. KIRBY: I’m not going to preview any potential policy decisions coming forward.,What we want to see are some real changes on the Israeli side. And, you know, if we don’t see changes from their side, there will have to be changes from our side.,But I won’t preview what that could look like.,Now —,Q Is that just body count —,MR. KIRBY: — they talked about — wha- — I’m sorry?,Q Is that just the body count, or is there specific changes?,MR. KIRBY: Again, I’m — I’m — in terms of concrete steps, what we are looking to see and hope to see here in coming hours and days is a dramatic increase in the humanitarian assistance getting in, additional crossings opened up, and a reduction in the violence against civilians and certainly aid workers. We want to — we want to see that — that even as the Israelis work through their investigation that they are willing and able to take practical, immediate steps to protect aid workers on the ground and to demonstrate that they — that they have that civilian harm mitigation in place.,So, again, those are broad brushes. I’ll let the Israelis speak to what they will or won’t do here. But, again, in coming hours and days, we will be looking for concrete, tangible steps that they’re taking.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Nancy.,Q Thanks. John, just to go back to that point. In your readout, when you say the President made clear that the U.S. — “that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action,” could you decode that for us? What exactly is the warning that’s being issued here?,MR. KIRBY: I think it’s very clear in the language itself, Nancy. We’re going to — the — we’re looking for concrete steps to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Gaza.,Again, I won’t get ahead of what the Israelis will or won’t say or announce. We’re looking for concrete steps to be announced here soon.,And it’s not just about the announcement of concrete steps and changes in their policies, but it’s the execution of those announcements and those decisions and implementing them.,And so, we’re — we obviously will — will watch closely and monitor how — how they do on — on the commitments that they make. And as — as I said earlier, if there’s no changes to their policy and their approaches, then there’s going to have to be changes to ours.,Q I think — I think what the world wants to understand is: Is the White House warning that it may remove military aid? What exactly is the threat here?,MR. KIRBY: I think I’ve — I’ve stated it pretty clearly. And I’m not going to — I’m not going to — as I said earlier, I’m not going to preview steps. I’m not going to preview decisions that haven’t been made yet. But there are things that need to be done.,There are too many civilians being killed. The risk to aid workers is unacceptable. Now we have certain aid organizations that are reconsidering whether they’re even going to be able to continue operations in Gaza while famine looms. So, there has to be tangible steps.,Let’s see what they announce. Let’s see what they direct. Let’s see what they do. But I’m not going to get ahead of that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Mary.,Q So, I’m going to try this one more time, because the President seems —,MR. KIRBY: I reckoned you would. (Laughter.),Q That’s what we do. The President seems to have said to — to the Prime Minister today, you know, “Make these concrete changes or else.” It’s the “or else” that I want to make clear here. Is the President threatening to withhold aid to Israel if they do not make these changes?,MR. KIRBY: The President made it clear that our policies with respect to Gaza will be dependent upon our assessment of how well the Israelis make changes and implement changes to make the situation in Gaza better for the Palestinian people.,Q And how much time are you giving them to make these changes, to implement these concrete steps?,MR. KIRBY: Again, we — we would hope to see some announcements of changes here in coming hours and days. And I’ll leave it at that.,Q That’s short.,MR. KIRBY: Hours and days.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.,Q John, why today?,MR. KIRBY: Why today what?,Q Why was —,MR. KIRBY: Why today for the phone call? Why —,Q Why — why this apparent shift in policy today? The —,MR. KIRBY: I think — look, the President — well, all of us, but particularly the President — was certainly shaken by the attack on the WCK convoy and the aid workers. As I said earlier, it wasn’t the only event. There had been others like that: humanitarian aid convoys coming under fire and losing people.,And — and the President felt strongly that it was time to — to talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu about his concerns.,Q Would you characterize this call as an ultimatum?,MR. KIRBY: I would characterize this call as very direct, very businesslike, very professional on both sides. And the President laid out his significant concerns about the direction and where things are going and, quite frankly, laid out, as is clear in the readout, that — that we are willing to reconsider our own policy approaches here, dependent upon what the Israelis do or don’t do.,Q And can you just tell us who all was on the call?,MR. KIRBY: Well, it was — it was a bilateral call between the two leaders — Prime Minister Netanyahu and the President. They were the only two speakers on the — on the call.,Q Okay. But Vice President Harris also dialed in or —,MR. KIRBY: Vice President Harris did — did dial in, yes.,Q And the Secretary of State and the —,MR. KIRBY: Secretary of State dialed in. Jake Sullivan, yes. I don’t know who was also listening in on the Israeli side. But the — but the discussion was between the two leaders.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: M.J.,Q So, Admiral, you’re not specifying what concrete steps Israel must take exactly.,MR. KIRBY: I — I gave you some — a broad sense of it. We want to see more crossings opened up. We want to see more trucks getting in, particularly from Jordan. We want to see tangible steps at the mitigation of civilian harm, particularly to humanitarian aid workers but, obviously, all civilians. But we want to see that they have — that they have moved forward on proper steps to deconflict with aid workers as they move around, that the information flow is viable.,Q Sure. But that’s language we’ve heard for weeks now. You’re not talking about sort of telling us how exactly you will measure those measurable steps, right?,MR. KIRBY: What I said was we’re going to — we’re going to examine our policy approaches based on the — our assessment of the way the Israeli side modifies their behavior, modifies their policy and decision-making processes.,And so, first of all, let’s see what they say they’re going to do. And then let’s watch and see how they execute to what they say and do.,I don’t want to get ahead of them on what they — on what they — what they plan to say about the changes they’re going to make. But we- — we’ll base our policy decisions based on an assessment of how they execute to their policy decisions.,Q Haven’t you been doing that all along?,Q And you’re not talking about what potential U.S. policy changes are on the table. Can you say whether the President shared that with the Prime Minister on this phone call?,MR. KIRBY: The President made clear that — that absent changes in the protection of civilians on the ground; absent changes to the volume of humanitarian assistance getting in; absent — absent any movement on a ceasefire that will allow hostages to get out and more aid to get in; absent, you know, a calming down, that he will have to reconsider his own policy choices with respect to — to Gaza.,Q And one of the seven aid workers was obviously a dual American citizen. Did the Prime Minister offer the President an apology?,MR. KIRBY: I — I — I’ll let the Prime Minister speak to his side of the conversation. The — I would note that the Israeli Defense Forces, their Southern Command commander has made a public apology for the — the strike.,Q And there was no mention of Rafah in this readout. Can you talk to us about how — if that did come up and how that might have been discussed between the two leaders?,MR. KIRBY: This conversation was — was focused primarily on the need to get a temporary ceasefire in place, the need for there to be a pause in — in the fighting so that we can get the hostages out, humanitarian assistance; the need to see that steps are being taken to learn from this strike and to make changes in the way civilian harm is mitigated from an operational perspective.,And they did spend time, as the readout makes clear, talking about the very public threats from — from Iran to Israel. And the President, as I said, made very clear to the Prime Minister that the United States’ support for Israel’s ability to defend itself from a range of threats, not just Hamas, remains ironclad.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Danny.,Q Thanks, Karine. Thanks, Admiral. Just a couple of things. Firstly, how — how long did this call last?,MR. KIRBY: It was about 30 minutes or so.,Q And just going back to, I mean, Jeff’s question about the — you know, why — why the sort of change in tone. I mean, has there been growing frustration on the part of President Biden that previous messaging to Prime Minister Netanyahu just doesn’t seem to have gotten through?,MR. KIRBY: Yes, there has been growing frustration.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Raquel.,Q Thank you so much, Karine. John, one question on Israel and another on Venezuela. We saw, in the past, President Biden pushing Netanyahu to protect civilians, but how much words really matter here when — on actions, the same day of the attack on the humanitarian words — the U.S. was approving more bombs to Israel? The U- — we are now six months into the war. How much the U.S. actions are actually encouraging Israel to not do enough to protect civilians?,MR. KIRBY: Yeah, look, I — I’m kind of glad the question came up, because I would tell you, when — I’ve seen press reporting, you know, about the — about the — the arms sales and that kind of thing. And I would just remind you that — that it — with the exception of the immediate two months after the attack, we haven’t really sent emergency aid and assis- — military assistance to — to Israel. There was in the first couple of months.,But what you’re seeing here is the result of a — a process of foreign military sales to Israel that takes years, and a lot of this materiel that’s been reported publicly was notified to Congress many, many months, if not years ago, and are in the train to get to Israel.,I think it’s important to remember, as I tried to mention in the last answer, that Israel still has a lot of threats it faces. I mean, we’re all focused on Hamas, and I understand that, but they still face active threats throughout the region, including from Iran. And the United States still has an ironclad commitment to help Ir- — Israel with its self-defense. And so, a lot of these articles, including the 2,000-pound bombs and the F-35s, that’s — those are things that have been long in the train and not tied — the sale — the foreign military sales process was not tied to this conflict.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Tam.,Q Can I have a one more —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — on Ven- — on Venezuela quick. Because yesterday, Nicolás Maduro enacted a law creating a province of Venezuela in Guyana, and he accused the United States of building secret military bases in Essequibo. So, what is your reaction? And is the U.S. considering build a military base to support Guyana to defend their sovereignty?,MR. KIRBY: There’s no p- — there’s no plans for a secret military base.,And we’ve said ma- — many times that there’s an 1899 arbitral ruling about the border between Guyana and Venezuela, and we want both sides to respect that ruling and to do it peacefully.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Tam.,Q Thank you. You said, “We would hope to see an announcement of changes.” I’m wondering if that is just hope or is it an expectation?,MR. KIRBY: We ex- —,Q Is it based on a commitment?,MR. KIRBY: We expect that — that there will be some — some announcements coming from Israel in the coming hours and days, but I want to respect their right to manage that process on their own.,Q Okay. And was there any update given by the Prime Minister on what exactly happened with the World Central Kitchen envoy?,MR. KIRBY: They — they didn’t talk about the actual strike in great detail. The — the Prime Minister did reiterate, as his military has reiterated, that this was on them; that the investigation was — was concluding; that he looked forward to seeing it; and that, you know, he would take appropriate actions to make sure something like that couldn’t happen again.,I mean, they did — obviously, they talked about it, of course. But did they go through point by point the investigation’s findings? No, because I think the Prime Minister’s office is still evaluating the actual investigation results.,Q And just to try to get a technical understanding as you described the very long process of supplying arms to Israel, if this contingency isn’t met and there is a change in U.S. policy, how easy or hard would it be to slow down or change shipments to Israel based on current law and all of the requirements and all the things you just described?,MR. KIRBY: Yeah, again, I don’t want to get ahead of where we are. Let’s see what the Israeli side does and says and what they implement and where they go before we talk about actual policy decisions.,And I’m certainly not going to close down decision space for the President of the United States. He gets to make those decisions. But I mean, obviously, as Commander-in-Chief — and, yes, the foreign military sales certainly is — is supported by legislation, but — but there are certain authorities that you can do to manage that.,But, again, let’s not get ahead of where we are. This is really about seeing what the Israelis say they’re going to do and then act on — on those — on those changes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Gabe.,Q Admiral, has the U.S. lost its leverage with Prime Minister Netanyahu?,MR. KIRBY: You know, I keep getting this question about leverage. Israel is an ally and a friend and a partner. And the President believes strongly, and has for his entire public career, in the security of the Israeli people and the — and the longevity of the Israeli state. And that’s not going to change.,And I can say unequivocally — and I don’t think the Prime Minister would mind me saying here — that, in the call today, the Prime Minister reiterated his thanks to President Biden and this administration for the support that — that we have continued to provide Israel. It’s longstanding. It was before the 7th of October, and it is now. And that support is — that support is going to continue.,But, again, with respect to Gaza, we need to see certain changes. And if we don’t, then we’ll have to consider changes to our own policy.,But it’s not about — it’s not about leverage. It’s about the relationship, and it’s about the credibility — I would even say the unique credibility that this particular president has in Israel and with Israeli leadership based on his long public service of support to —,Q But you talk about this relationship. Do you think the Prime Minister is really listening?,MR. KIRBY: It was — I think it was evident in the phone call today. It was a good discussion. Direct — no question — but a good discussion. And — and I believe the — the President made very clear his concerns and the Prime Minister acknowledged those concerns.,Q And in — and in terms of the timing of this call, we understand that this call was set up after the strike on the World Central Kitchen workers. Would you say that this call was a direct result of that? Was that the reason behind the call?,MR. KIRBY: Yes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Nadia.,Q And then, one —,Q Thank you.,Q — one last thing: response to José Andrés. Chef Andrés says that the convoy was deliberately targeted. Any response from the U.S. on that?,MR. KIRBY: Again, I — I haven’t seen the Israeli investigation. They have said themselves publicly, after a preliminary investigation, that there was no deliberate targeting of WCK and — and Chef Andrés. They — they’re working their way through, now, independent follow-on investigation, which I understand is very, very close to complete.,The Prime Minister just talked about it broadly. And reiterated today — the Prime Minister reiterated today that there was no deliberate targeting of — of that aid convoy.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Nadia.,Q Thank you, Karine. Two questions. Senator Coons, who is very close to the President, said that we have reached a moment where arms restriction to Israel should be considered. Senator Warren also said that we have — Israel has violated our own laws. Are they wrong in their assessment?,MR. KIRBY: The President — I think it’s clear in the readout, Nadia, that the — that the President has — has made it clear today that if we don’t see changes to the way the IDF is treating innocent civilians and aid workers and flowing the humanitarian assistance, that he’s going to have to reconsider our Gaza policy. So, I mean, he was very direct with the Prime Minister about that.,I’m not going to close down his decision space. As satisfying as that may be for some of you, I can’t do that.,But he made it very clear that we need to see some changes on the Israeli side.,Q Okay. I want to ask you about very disturbing investigative report by an Israeli journalist who said that — is the White House aware of an AI program called “Lavender” that’s being used by the Israeli army to target operative in Gaza in what they call a “kill zone,” where this program has only 20 seconds of human supervision. And it led to the death of thousands of women and children in Gaza. Do you think — are you aware of it, number one? And, second, does the White House believe that AI can be used in this way with that supervision?,MR. KIRBY: I’m — I’m not aware of it. You’re going to have to let me take question. We’ll get back to you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.,Q Thank you so much, John. I’m going to start with the trilateral summit, then I’m going to move to Rwanda.,First of all, looking ahead to the trilateral summit next week, what are some of the priorities? And we recently heard the Filipino Ambassador say that the U.S., Japan, and the Philippines are going to start joint patrols in the South China Sea very soon. Can you confirm that and give us any details?,MR. KIRBY: I believe the Pentagon will have more to say about that this afternoon. So, I don’t — I don’t want to get ahead of — of them on that. We’re always looking for opportunities to improve cooperation with our allies in the Indo-Pacific.,We’re looking forward to this trilateral summit next week. I think it’ll be very, very important. As you know, we have self-defense treaty commitments with both countries. And so, the chance to sit down with — with both his Japanese and his Filipino counterparts is something the President is very much looking forward to.,There’s an awful lot to discuss. Certainly, the tensions in the South China Sea are not going away. That was an issue that was raised in the President’s call with President Xi just a — a couple of days ago. And so, there’s — there’s an awful lot to talk about there.,Q Cool. Then on Rwanda —,MR. KIRBY: Cool.,Q I’m going to ask — (laughter) — a multi-part question.,Q Cool.,Q It’s —,MR. KIRBY: I did not think my answer was cool, but I appreciate the compliment. (Laughter.),Q It’s — sorry, it’s a small country. It doesn’t get a lot of attention. But President Biden has decided to send President Clinton —,MR. KIRBY: Correct.,Q — to observe the 30th anniversary of the genocide. You know, what message does this send to Rwandans who are understandably upset about President Clinton’s lack of action when the genocide was happening?,Secondly, what message is President Clinton taking to President Kagame, who has been in power since 1994 and has become increasingly authoritarian?,And then, finally, in 1998, President Clinton pledged to the Rwandan people that his administration was going to work to identify triggers of genocidal activity so that something like this would never happen again. Do you think Washington has improved on that front in the last 30 years?,MR. KIRBY: We — we — I — I believe — I can’t speak for every administration between 1998 and today, but I can tell you that President Biden absolutely takes those responsibilities very, very seriously, particularly when it comes to genocidal threats, wherever they occur around the world.,And he’s very grateful that President Clinton has agreed to lead the delegation for the 30th anniversary. Eight hundred thousand people slaughtered in that — in that —,Q Some people say it’s over 1.2 million.,MR. KIRBY: — in that conflict. And our hearts and our prayers go out to the families of the — of the survivors — of those who were — who were killed. Just a — just a dreadful situation.,And, again, the President is grateful that President Clinton has agreed to — to go down there and represent the administration.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Phil.,Q Thank you. I have two questions, one on Israel and another on China.,At this point in the conflict, does President Biden believe that a military victory against Hamas is possible for Israel?,MR. KIRBY: Obviously, that’s going to be up to the Israeli Defense Forces and the Israeli government to determine.,As I’ve said many, many times: It’s difficult to eliminate an ideology with military means, but you can absolutely, through military means, decapitate their leadership; dry up their resources; eliminate their infrastructure, their ability to — to operate and store weapons, train troops. I mean, all of that stuff can be — can be targeted with military means.,What — the — but as I’ve also said, and — and you have to keep it in the context of this call, it matters how you do that. It really matters a lot how you do that.,And it’s the how that the President was focused on today and the — the way these operations are being prosecuted and the additional harm that’s coming to civilian aid workers and innocent Gazans.,Q And then, Xi reportedly told President Biden during their summit in San Francisco that Beijing plans to reunify Taiwan with Mainland China. Did the Chinese leader bring up a similar sentiment in their call the other day? And if so, what was President Biden’s response?,MR. KIRBY: I wou- — certainly, Taiwan came up in the context of — of the call. There’s not a single discussion that we don’t have with senior leaders in the PRC where we don’t talk about Taiwan. Of course, it came up.,I — I won’t characterize President Xi’s comments. But I can tell you that — that President Biden was very, very clear that — that nothing has changed about our One China policy. We don’t support independence for Taiwan. But we also don’t want to see the status quo changed in a unilateral way and certainly not by force.,Q Thank you, sir.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay, a couple more. Go ahead, Jared.,Q Did — I know you said that Rafah wasn’t the point of this conversation and it wasn’t discussed a lot. Does that mean that that is still sort of a separate issue that’s going to be sort of an ongoing discussion between U.S. and Israeli officials in the delegation?,MR. KIRBY: I don’t know that I’d call it separate. It wasn’t a focus of this call. The call was — as I answered to M.J., it was really about the humanitarian situation and changes we need to see.,But we look forward to having another conversation with Israeli counterparts in coming days, hopefully in a week or so, on Rafah specifically. And we hope this next one will be in person, but we’ll have more to say about that as we get closer to it.,Q So, an operation in Rafah would not, sort of, run counter to — to these new conditions that the President laid out to — to the Prime Minister?,MR. KIRBY: Oh, I didn’t say that at all. I mean, one of the big concerns about a ground operation in Rafah that we’ve expressed is the damage it could do — the death and destruction it could render to the 1.5 million Gazans that are seeking refuge there.,So, again, today’s call was really focused on humanitarian assistance, civilian casualties, and that includes humanitarian aid workers. You can’t talk about Rafah and the possibility of operations going after those Hamas battalions in Rafah without also talking about the humanitarian situation down there, which is dire.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Brian.,Q Thanks a lot, Admiral. Does President Biden agree with Donald Trump that the — Israel’s war against Hamas is taking a long time?,MR. KIRBY: I’m not going to compare the President’s views to — to Mr. Trump. I think you can understand I need to stay out — out of that.,All I would tell you is we have expressed our concerns about the manner in which operations are being conducted and the — the speed and the energy with which we want to see changes to the way those operations are being conducted. And I think I’d leave it at that.,Q Well, does — does the President think that Israel’s war against Hamas is taking too long?,M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

. KIRBY: The President believes that they have a right to go after the Hamas threat, which is still viable. And the President made it clear again today that we support and we will continue to support — not just philosophically but tangibly — Israel’s right to defend itself against a range of threats. And it — certainly that includes this — this fight against Hamas.,But, again, I want to — I want to reiterate what I said earlier. It’s not just the threat of Hamas that Israel is facing. They are facing broader threats throughout the region, including directly and publicly from — from Iran.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Peter.,Q John, a follow-up on that first. Did the CIA warn Israel or did President Biden warn Netanyahu today about an Iranian plan to attack inside Israel within 48 hours?,MR. KIRBY: I’m not going to talk about intelligence matters, Peter. I think you can understand. But they did talk about a very public and very viable, real threat by Iran to Israel’s security. And I think I need to leave it at that. It’s really as far as I can go.,Q On October 7th, President Biden said, “My administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.” That is not true anymore, correct?,MR. KIRBY: That i- — no, it is true. Still true today.,Q How is his support unwavering, but you’re also reconsidering policy choices?,MR. KIRBY: Both can be true.,Q They cannot be true. They’re — they’re completely different things.,MR. KIRBY: No. No, no. I just —,Q He is —,MR. KIRBY: I’m sorry — I —,Q He is wavering.,MR. KIRBY: Now, now, now. Come on, Peter.,Q How is he not wavering?,MR. KIRBY: Come on. (Laughter.) Come on, now.,As I said, and as it says in that readout, we made clear — and — and he made it clear to the Prime Minister in his call — that our support for Israel’s self-defense remains ironclad. They face a range of threats. And the United States isn’t going to walk away from helping Israel defend itself.,That said, you can say all that and you can act on that and you can believe that — and the President does — and still believe that the manner in which they’re defending themselves against the Hamas threat needs to change. And that is the conversation that we had today.,But both things are true. Our support is ironclad and consistent. It’s not going to — not going to stop; it’s not going to — not going to — not going to waver. But will there perhaps be some policy changes we might have to make if we don’t see policy changes out of Israel? Yes.,Q How is that unwavering? It sounds like you guys are trying to have it both ways here.,MR. KIRBY: No. I don’t know that I’d char- —,Q “We support Israel, but we are going to make all these changes because we don’t support Israel.”,MR. KIRBY: I didn’t say we’re going to make changes. I said we need to see w- — how Israel responds to the humanitarian crises in Gaza and how they respond to protection of aid workers. I think we can all agree, I think you would agree, you don’t want to see innocent civilians killed or targeted, do you? You don’t want to see Gazans starve. You don’t want to see famine in Gaza, do you?,Q Nobody wants to see —,MR. KIRBY: Of course not.,Q — that. But you’re —,MR. KIRBY: So —,Q — the policymaker and you’re talking about policy changes.,MR. KIRBY: So —,Q That is not what you were talking about on October 7th.,MR. KIRBY: Because things have —,Q When it was “solid and unwavering.”,MR. KIRBY: On October 7th, there wasn’t near famine in Gaza. On October 7th, there wasn’t a diminution of trucks getting into Gaza. On October 7th, we didn’t see thousands and thousands of innocent people killed. I mean, I could go on and on.,The — we’re talking about a conflict near — which is dang near at six months here — this weekend, six months. And it has changed over time. And the — what the President’s message today was: We need to see some changes in the way Israel is dealing with that threat.,Q And —,MR. KIRBY: That’s — that’s what two good friends and allies can discuss.,This isn’t about un- — this isn’t about changing our support to Israel or the security of the Israeli state. And I — I just have to take issue with the premise of the question.,Q Okay. Just the last one, then. Where is President Biden on any of this? When he wants to talk about how angry he is or frustrated he is about the high cost of insulin, he comes out and gives an impassioned speech. Where is he on any of this?,MR. KIRBY: He’s been talking about this. He’s been issuing statements on this.,Q In private.,MR. KIRBY: No, that statement, last I looked, was public.,Q But where is he? Why isn’t he here right now?,MR. KIRBY: Look, I’m sure you’ll continue to hear from the President about this and many other national security issues.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. We’ve got to — we’ve got to wrap it up.,Go ahead.,Q Thanks. Can you share any- — anything about White House views on the upcoming U.N. Security Council resolution to prohibit nuclear weapons in space, which is scheduled to vote as soon as Friday?,MR. KIRBY: Yeah, actually, I can. And if you don’t mind, I’m — I do have some notes. I want to make sure that I get this right.,But, I think, last month, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced that the United States and Japan would put forward a Security Council resolution calling on all countries not to deploy nuclear weapons in space or to develop nuclear weapons specifically designed to be placed in orbit around the Earth. And we will be bringing this resolution to a vote in New York early next week.,Now, the vote should be straightforward. The Outer Space Treaty — which has been signed by more than 130 countries, including Russia, the PRC, and, of course, the United States — prohibits the deployment of, quote, “nuclear weapons or other kinds of weapons of mass destruction,” end quote, in orbit, period.,Now, we have heard President Putin say that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space, so we look forward to Russia voting in favor of this resolution. There should be no reason why not to. And if they do, then I think that should open up some really legitimate questions to Mr. Putin about what his intentions really are.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead. S.V., you have the last question.,Q Yeah, thank you. Admiral, could you clarify on the — the ceasefire language that the President used in his statement? He says that he und- — that there should be a ceasefire, and then the next — after a comma, it’s, “he urged the Prime Minister to empower… negotiators to conclude a deal without delay.” So, are the two tied together? Or is he saying ceasefire right now and then the other thing later? I mean, what —,MR. KIRBY: We — we —,Q How immediate is “immediate”?,MR. KIRBY: I — I can’t really improve upon the President’s language. We — we want to see a pause in the fighting. We want to see a ceasefire immediately, so that we can get more humanitarian assistance in and create a set of conditions where aid organizations feel better about operating inside Gaza because, as we — we’ve already seen it in — as a result of the attack on the WCK workers, that some aid organizations now are pulling back. So, we want to see that immediate ceasefire in place.,We also, of course, as we’ve said many times, think that that could also provide a window here to get the hostages out.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Thanks. Thank you so much.,(Cross-talk.),MR. KIRBY: Thank you very much.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks, Admiral.,Q John, before you go, was it an ultimatum? Was it an ultimatum?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Thank you so much, Admiral.,Go ahead.,Q Thanks, Karine.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: That was a lot of screaming.,Q Was before — either before the call or after the call, has the White House briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill about this potential change in U.S. policy, what is at stake here?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, I think the Admiral made it very clear. We are giving the Israeli government an opportunity to deal with something that is pretty serious: humanitarian aid workers who are — you know, who are, we saw this week, being killed. I think we talked about — we’ve seen that ov- — more than 200 humanitarian aid workers in the past several months.,And so, that needs to stop. And so, we’re giving the Israeli government, as you heard from my colleague, to come up with some — some ways — some — you know, some measures here on how to avoid that. We have to keep civilians — civilians safe; we have to keep humanitarian workers safe.,And so, I don’t want to get ahead of that. We’re always having conversations, always in contact with congressional members. I don’t have a readout of outreach that was done right after the call. Obviously, the call ended not too long ago. And so, don’t want to — to get ahead of that.,But I think in that readout the President made it very clear where he stand — where he — where he stands in this moment. He made it very clear after the horrific — you know, the — what happened — the horrific events of seven — seven, you know, brave people doing — doing heroic work — what happened to them. He put out a very strong statement.,So, I think the President has been very clear. He’s outraged, he’s heartbroken, and this needs to stop. We need to protect civilian lives. That’s why he’s having — that’s why his team is having conversat- — conversations with the Israeli government on Rafah operations and what that’s going to look like. They’re having a — a, you know, reasonable debate back and forth and — and talking about that.,We’re hoping — we — we expect that to happen in person very shortly. And so, the President has been very clear: We got to protect civilian lives; we have to protect humanitarian aid workers. And — and those conversations certainly are going to continue.,Q And you got a question yesterday whether the President’s conv- — conversation, with the doctor who had been in Gaza, on Tuesday was his first interaction with somebody who had been on the ground in Gaza since the war began. I was hoping you might have a — be able to give us an answer on that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, a couple of things. I did have a moment to look into that. And so, as you know, the President and his senior team have been pretty actively honoring their commitment he made on — in continuing that ongoing engagement with communities directly, obviously, impacted by the conflict in Gaza. And he did that by hosting community leaders just this week. But, also, you’ve seen the senior White House officials going to Michigan, going to Illinois, and continuing those conversations over the past several months.,So, look — and we believe and — that by going across the country and hearing directly from community leaders in numerous states, that we’re doing — we are keeping that ongoing commitment.,And so, look, the three doctors — there were three doctors who recently returned from Gaza who participated in the meeting this week, and they shared their firsthand experience with President Biden. And so, we can say that there were three doctors.,We’re trying to be really respectful in keeping the privacy of those who are attending these very private meetings. But we were able to share — I am able to share there were at least three doctors who have — who have had the firsthand experience, have gone to Gaza, and they were able to share — to share their firsthand experience with the President.,And so, I can share that. But I also want to be really careful, because we do want to keep our commitment in keeping these conversations private. And that includes the atten- — the attendees.,Q But that was the first time though that the President has interacted with anybody who had been on the ground, correct?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, what I can say is didn’t go — I have not checked in on — on that. Right? I want to be really care- —,Q Not since (inaudible)? Okay.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, no. But I think three doctors coming to the meeting the other day — yesterday and laying out their first account, I think that’s important, right? So, we’re able to share that information with you: three doctors who were — who’ve been in Gaza, and they we- — shared directly with the President what they have seen on the ground. That matters, right? It’s — so, want to be very clear about that.,Look, we are going to continue to keep our commitment in hearing from folks in the communities who have been directly affected by this. That’s been our commitment from very early on.,We understand how painful this is for many. We understand how important it is to hear directly from Americans. This is what the President wants to do. He’s the president for all Americans. He has said that continuously on any issue.,And on this issue, it is important to do that as well.,Q And then, yesterday, you got a question that said the President had been briefed on this avian flu outbreak. I’m wondering has — is the President going to designate any sort of coordinator at the White House or —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — for the federal government to manage those (inaudible)?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I’m glad that you asked that question, because we do have a couple of things to share with all of you. The President has been briefed. I think I may have sa- — shared that yesterday as well.,Look, the health and safety of American public is very serious. We take that very seriously. Our top priority, obviously, is to keep communities healthy, safe, and informed.,What we were able to do is the White House — immediately, the White House stood up a response team with relevant agencies — like the CDC, FDA, USDA — to ensure that we are doing everything in our power to ensure we keep communities healthy, safe, and informed; ensure that our nation’s food supply remains safe; and monitor any and all trends to mitigate risk and prevent the spread of avian flu.,We are also in regular touch with those relevant agencies and receiving daily updates because, again, we take that very seriously.,And this is an issue — when you think about the avian flu, this is — public experts, health experts, and agencies have been preparing for this for decades — for 20 years now.,And so, we have invested the ability to test, the ability to prevent and to treat. And so, as CDC said themselves, right now, the risk to human health from this outbreak is low. But we want to keep it that way, which is why we set up this — this immediate response team.,And so, we’re going to monitor — continue to monitor, and — and we’re going to look for all the relev- — relevant trends as it relates to the avian flu. And we want to make sure that we keep all Americans safe.,Thank you for the question. I think it’s important.,Go ahead, M.J.,Q Karine, if Speaker Johnson were to put some form of Ukraine aid on the floor and a lawmaker, say Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, then moves to oust him, would the White House, would the President support Democrats working to keep him as Speaker?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, we’ve always been very ca- — very, very careful when it comes to leadership. And we have always said, when it comes to picking the Speaker, picking the Leader in the Senate, we want to let Congress deal with that. We want — in this case, it’s something that House Republicans have to decide on. That’s something that — that Leader Jeffries and his caucus have to decide on. We are not going to weigh in on that. We’ve been very consistent over the past three years, and we stand by that.,Q Any recent contact with the Speaker’s office that you can read out?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have anything to read out to you at this time. Obviously, our Office of Leg Affairs is in constant communication with congressional members on the Hill.,And I do want to just say — and we’ve been pretty consistent about this — when it comes to the national security supplemental that i- — includes all important Ukrainian aid. We believe that there’s bipartisan — there continues to be bipartisan support in Congress. The Speaker needs to put that on the floor. He needs to make sure that — that he gives House members an opportunity to vote for that. We believe it would get overwhelming support.,And we have to remember there are lives at stakes — there are live at stake here in — in Ukraine. And the brave people of Ukraine need the assistance from the U.S. to continue to fight for their democracy. That’s what we’ve been able to do for more than two years. We got to continue that.,And because of congressional inaction, we have — sadly, have seen that, you know, they’re — them — the Ukrainians — losing ground in the battlefield. And so, we believe: Put it out on the floor — Sp- — the Speaker needs to do that; let the con- — congressional members vote on it. We think it’ll get overwhelming support — 72-29 coming out of the Senate for that national security supplemental. It got to move. It has to move; lives are at stake here.,Go ahead.,Q Karine, was the President briefed yesterday or did he see the comments by José Andrés in his interview with Reuters?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: He’s aware. He’s aware. He’s been — he’s been briefed, and he’s aware by the comments.,Look, you saw the President — we — we put that in the s- — in his statement. Obviously, he — we made sure that it was in his statement how he felt about his relationship, his friendtr- — friendship with Chef — Chef Andrés.,They — he considers him a friend. He sees him as a hero in everything that he has done — not just in Gaza but across the globe in feeding — in feeding people who are in need — the humanitarian assistant that he provides. We have said the — the op-ed that he wrote is incredibly powerful. And he — you know, that — the first couple of words out of his statement yesterday was “outrage” and “heartbroken.” Seven people died.,Q Is he —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Outrage and heart- — heartbroken.,Q Is he concerned about the discrepancy, though, between how Chef Andrés described a deliberate attack on his workers versus what the White House and —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah —,Q — Israel have said in terms of describing that attack?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, there’s an investigation — ongoing investigation; we’re going to let that investigation move forward. And we certainly — I think we all can understand how heartbroken Chef José Andrés is at this moment. We understand that. We are mourning with him. We are mourning with the families that lost their loved ones. So, we can be sensitive to that.,But as it relates to making any declarative statement, we have to make sure that this investigation moves forward, and it is. And we will see where that takes us.,Go ahead, Nancy.,Q Thanks, Karine. The presidents of — the par- — parents, rather, of Jacob Flickinger, who is the American citizen who was killed in the World Central Kitchen strike — they said this morning they haven’t heard from anyone in the U.S. government, except for that first day when they got a notification from the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Does the President or anyone else at the White House plan to reach out to them?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I don’t have a readout for you at this time.,Look, we’ve been always very clear about this, that our hearts — and I just said this to Jeff — our hearts go out to the families. It is tragic — tragic. We send our deepest, deepest condolences, obviously, to the family of Jacob.,And, you know, he and the World — World Centra- — Central Kitchen workers were doing heroic work, as I just mentioned, and what happened — what happened on the ground as they were doing that heroic work in Gaza is tragic. It’s devastating. It’s heartbreaking.,And we just don’t have any additional calls to read out right now. I expect members of the administration to be in touch with the — with the family to express our — our condolences directly. Just don’t have any — anything to read out at this time.,But obviously, our hearts go out to all the families who lost — who lost some- — who lost someone they loved.,Q And several Democrats are now calling for an independent investigation into what happened here. Is the White House open to changing its position on this?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: We’re going to let Israeli — the Israeli government do their investigation and see where that takes us. Don’t want to get ahead of that. They’re doing an investigation.,We have said we want it to be comprehensive. We want it to be — make sure there — it — that it has accountability. We want it to be swift, obviously. And we want it to be public. So, don’t want to get ahead of that — let that process move forward. And we’ll see where we are from there.,Okay. Go ahead.,Q Thanks, Karine. So, yesterday, John Kirby said that the U.S. would not consider a shift in their policy towards Israel until they finished their review of the World Central Kitchen strike. And just now, he said that the U.S. may consider a change if they don’t make changes in Gaza within hours and days. So, where is that — where is that shift coming from?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think it’s — we’re talking about that — the conversation that happened today with the President, as we have said, was very direct, it was productive, it was professional — a 30-minute conversation. And it was based on humanitarian aid; protecting aid workers, which is really important; protecting civilians. And that’s what the conversation was primarily about.,And what we have said — it’s in the readout — that we want to see measurable changes to protect those aid workers, to protect civilian lives. And so, that is what is — he was talking about. That’s what he — the President laid out in — in the statement that we put out. You heard that from Secretary Blinken today.,And I think that’s the way that we want to make sure that we’re — you know, we want b- — be very clear about that. We want to see measurable changes to how humanitarian aids workers are protected. That’s what the conversation was about, and that’s the changes that we want to see the Israeli government present. That’s what he was talking about in the days to come.,Q Yeah. And if I could just get one more.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sure.,Q Yesterday, Benny Gantz, the Israeli War Cabinet Minister, called for Israel to hold early elections by September. Where does the White House stand on that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: We’re not going to — we’re not going to get involved in the Israeli government or any government’s elections. That is something for them to decide on. It’s not coming from here.,Go ahead.,Q I have a question about electric vehicles. Ford said today it’s delaying production on an electric SUV. Tesla earlier this week said that its sales are plunging. Do these types of developments make the administration rethink their EV policy?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, not at all. Look, you know, when it comes to EV sales, they are reaching record highs. EVs are more affordable than ever, and that’s because of the work that this administration has done. Last year, EV sales surpassed 1 million for the first time ever. That’s a 50 percent increase. That matters.,Under President Biden, EV sales have more than quadrupled. Sales of hybrids and EVs are now a record high of 18 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales. Average price of an EV is down 20 percent from just a year ago — just one year ago.,So, we believe that this is part of — well, I should say, the President has always said that he wants to make sure we do everything that we can to lower cost, lower prices — this is part of that — and also do eve- — all — everything that we can to deal with a climate crisis. And this is part of that.,Q So, is it realistic to go from about 7 or 8 percent of sales to 50 percent of sales in eight years if the automakers themselves are cutting back prod- — on production?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: We believe — and we have seen that — that U.S. manufact- — U.S. manufacturing jobs have increased. Jobs have indeed increased. And when you see so- — a boom like this, that means you need autoworkers, right? It can’t happen on its own.,And so, we — we believe this is working. We believe this is part of what the President has promised. And we want to see a manufacturing industry that’s for the future of this — of this country, and that’s what we’re seeing. And that’s what the President is work — working towards.,Q And a question about yesterday’s call with President Xi. If President Biden is concerned enough about TikTok to bring it up on a call with the President of China, why is he and why is the Vice President — why are they still making videos for TikTok?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: That’s coming out of the campaign, so I would refer you to the ca- —,Q But — but they’re —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Wait. Wait, that’s —,Q — doing the videos.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I understand. It is the campaign’s decision. I would refer you to the campaign.,We have been very clear: We are not trying to ban TikTok. We’re not trying to ban TikTok. We’re talking about a divestment. You heard that from the National Security Advisor when he has been here a couple of times at the podium speaking to TikTok and the legislation and how we’re trying to move forward. It is a — it is a platform that we really need to take seriously here. We’re talking about our national security.,And so, we’ve talked about not banning, divesting — not banning, divesting. So, I want to be very clear about that.,Go ahead, Karen.,Q Thanks, Karine. There’s a report from Bloomberg that the White House — specifically Jeff Zients and Lael Brainard — are calling major Baltimore employers, including Amazon and Home Depot, encouraging them to not cut jobs in the wake of the bridge collapse. Can you confirm that that outreach is happening and other outreach like that? And what is the message from the administration to those big companies?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, a couple of things that — and I think I’ve read this out before — that we have been doing as it relates to sup- — supply chain and the potential economic impact. The President’s Supply Chain Dis — Distribution Task Force has convened multiple times at this point to analyze the impact of supply chains, which has so far been manageable, which is important. The task force worked with railroads to set up new service lines and with ports and ocean carriers to divert vessels.,The SBA — the Small Business Administration — has made low-interest disaster loan assistance available to eligible businesses and set up business recovery centers to help on the ground.,As it relates to your question about Chief — the Chief — Chief of Staff Zients and other senior White House officials, they have had — they have called major employers in the Baltimore area, including retail chains and distributors, to encourage them to retain workers. So, we wanted to make sure that we’re having those important conversation for the people of Baltimore, obviously.,They’re also working with SBA to reach out to small businesses and are in touch with local unions alongside the Labor Department as well.,So, we’re going to do everything we can to have these conversations with stakeholders so that we can identify any — and address any potential disruptions.,And so, we — if anything, this should show that this is an adminis- — administration that’s being active. And we’re being proactive, obviously, in trying to make sure that — that we deal with any potential economic impact.,Right now, as I said at the top, we see this being manageable. And this is why the — these — these conversations are critical with stakeholders at this — this point.,Q And will the President have any update tomorrow for state and local officials about Congress moving forward on the funding package?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I’m not going to get ahead of — of the President. He — as you know, he’s going to be there on the ground. We’ll certainly have more to share later tonight. I — as I mentioned at the top, he’s going to have an opportunity to engage with family members. We lost — as you know, we lost lives on that night. And the President, as he does — he understands what it means for people to have loss. He’ll be there for those families, just like he’ll certainly be there for the people of Baltimore.,Go ahead. Go ahead, Emily.,Q Thanks, Karine. I had a question about the state dinner next week.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.),Q I saw the White House announced today the dinner itself is going to be held in the East Room. And I was just curious: The last state dinner was held on a tent on the South Lawn.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q Was the East Room chosen out of concern that protesters who have been —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No.,Q — coming after to the President might be shouting out —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No.,Q — past the South Lawn and (inaudible) the atmosphere?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No at all. We’ve — we’ve — it’s not the — it’s not the first state dinner that’s been held in the East Room. I believe, if I’m remembering correctly, South Korea was held in the East Room. So, I wouldn’t — I wouldn’t read too much into it.,Okay. I’m going to take one more.,Q Karine — it’s been a while, Karine.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. (Laughter.),Q Thank you very much.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I —,Q I appreciate you calling me, Karine.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I have thoughts, but I’m going to keep my thoughts to myself. (Laughter.),Q Thank you very much.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, go ahead. Go ahead.,Q I’d like to ask you —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — I appre- — you are correct. It’s been a while. So, go ahead.,Q Well, thank you. I’d like to ask you about press freedom and then about a significant White House personnel matter.,About press freedom —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.,Q — our government appears to be closer to potentially extraditing Julian Assange. Press freedom groups say that the case threatens to criminalize our profession. So, I’m wondering what the White House’s thinking is regarding that matter and the potential threat to press freedom. And does the White House have a stance on the pending federal press shield legislation that passed the House and that Senator Schumer told me he hopes reaches President Biden’s be- — desk this year?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You’re — you’re talking about the PRESS Act, more specifically?,Q Yes. Yes.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, and I said this — I’ve said this many times. I said this last week — where journalism is not a crime. We’ve been very clear about that.,And as it relates to this particular legislation, I haven’t reviewed it. Would have to talk to our Office of Leg Affairs on that particular legislation.,But I do want to say, back in October of 2022, the Justice Department codified a policy to ban subpoenas of journalist records.,The President strongly supports the right of free and independent press. That is something that the President talked about when he was at the Gridiron. The President talked about this at the last White House Correspondents Dinner. He has been very consistent about this.,And I’ll just quote him for a second: A free press is “a pillar of any free society.” And while we may not always agree with certain coverage or admire it, we do admire the courage of the free press. Journalism, again, is not a crime.,Q Before moving on, just to confirm. No stance yet on the PRESS Act that you’re aware of? And the Assange matter — is there a concern about that and its implications?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You know, I don’t have much more to share beh- — besides what I just laid out here. So, I’ll just leave it as what I just stated to you.,Q He’s been in prison five years.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I understand. I hear — I hear — I heard the question. I’m just not going to go beyond from what I just stated.,Q And on the personnel matter, I’d like to ask you about my reporting on Anthony Bernal, who is one of the most powerful figures in this White House. The First Lady reportedly refers to him as her “work husband.” Three former colleagues have made allegations of sexual harassment against him, building on prior reports of bullying. Some of these sources have worked with you. I — I think you’d find them credible. But Chief of Staff Zients issued a statement dismissing the allegations as “unfounded attacks” without even investigating them, which my sources say they’re alarmed about, because they say it could —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I —,Q — chill sexual harassment and bullying reports.,How can the White House potentially — or possibly justify not invest- — investigating these allegations when the President says he will fire people —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, a couple of things. I don’t know who your sources are, so I can’t — I — just, with all due respect, I can’t speak to that. Right? I — I just don’t. I mean, they’re blind sources. I can’t speak to that.,What I can speak to is: You saw our statement from our Chief of Staff, Jeffrey Zients, saying they are unfounded. You saw a very strong statement from Anthony himself. It was in your — obviously, in your reporting. And he said the same.,And I cannot speak to personnel investigations here or anything like that. That is not something I will ever speak to. And I’m not saying there is one. I’m just saying that I will never sp- — I cannot speak to that. And that’s not something I can do.,Q (Inaudible.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE: But — hold on. I have known Anthony for some time now. I have known him for more than a decade. I’ve worked closely with him. And I consider him a friend but also a colleague that I respect. And that’s basically what you also heard from Jeffrey Zients.,I just don’t have anything else to share beyond your reporting. I — I’m —,Q I’ve just got to press you on this, though —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, w- —,Q — because the President said he would —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, I — I don’t —,Q — fire people for disrespecting colleagues.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t have anything — but —,Q And there’s no investigation.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: But I just laid — I just said to you that they have said themselves — Jeffrey Zients and also Anthony Bernal — that they are unfounded.,I can’t speak to your sources. Those are your sources to speak to. I cannot. But no —,Q Does Bernal’s special status come from the First Lady shielding him —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Steve — Steven —,Q — as some sources believe?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I — I’ve answered the question. I’ve answered the question.,Bernal — Anthony Bernal spoke for himself. You heard from our Chief of Staff — our Chief of Staff — and gave your publication a statement, obviously. And you’ve heard from me. I — I’m — I don’t have a —,Q Is there not going to be a chilling effect, though, on —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I don’t — I don’t have anything else to share.,Q — people who have suffered sexual harassment or bullying?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: S- — I don’t have anything else to share on that.,With — so we don’t end in that way —,(Cross-talk.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.) Go ahead, Brian.,Q Thanks.,Q Real quick. I guess I want to just clean up something that you have spoken to today. Would you car- — categorize the conversation with Netanyahu that we’ve been told about all day long — was it an ultimatum? Did we deliver an ultimatum (inaudible)?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No. I mean, look —,Q Was it a shot across the bow?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Wait, hol- — it was — it was a direct conversation. It was a honest conversation. It lasted 30 minutes, as you heard from my colleague.,And we have said these many times before — you’ve heard this from us; you’ve heard this from the President himself: The — the Prime Minister and this President have known them — known each other for decades. And because they have known each other for some time, they have been able to have a direct and honest conversation.,And so, after what we saw — especially with seven — you know, seven lives taken from the — who were part of the World Central Kitchen workers — right? — who were doing heroic — heroic acts, providing humanitarian aid — you know, after what we saw — and you heard from the President: He was outra- — he was outraged. He was heartbroken. He wanted to have this direct conversation on how to keep humanitarian aid workers safe, protected — and also civilians — innocent civilians.,And that conversation has been happening for some time, and so — on protecting innocent civilian lives. I mean, that’s one of the reasons, as I stated moments ago, why he wanted to make sure that his team and the Prime Minister’s team came together to talk about their Rafah — potential Rafah operations, because he believes that we need to protect civilian lives and a major — major military operation was not the way to go, understanding that th- — there are Hamas operatives in Rafah. But we have to make sure that we protect innocent lives here.,So, they had a very direct conversation. That is — that is because they’ve known each other for many decades.,All right, everybody. Thank you so much.,Q Thank you.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE: We’ll see you — hopefully, we’ll see some of you in Baltimore tomorrow.,3:13 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,I am outraged and heartbroken by the deaths of seven humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen, including one American, in Gaza yesterday. They were providing food to hungry civilians in the middle of a war. They were brave and selfless. Their deaths are a tragedy.,Israel has pledged to conduct a thorough investigation into why the aid workers’ vehicles were hit by airstrikes. That investigation must be swift, it must bring accountability, and its findings must be made public.,Even more tragically, this is not a stand-alone incident. This conflict has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed. This is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult – because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians. Incidents like yesterday’s simply should not happen. Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians. The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties.,The United States will continue to do all we can to deliver humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, through all available means. I will continue to press Israel to do more to facilitate that aid. And we are pushing hard for an immediate ceasefire as part of a hostage deal. I have a team in Cairo working on this right now.,Earlier today, I spoke with my friend Chef José Andrés, the founder of World Central Kitchen, to convey my deepest condolences for the deaths of these courageous aid workers and to express my continued support for his and his team’s relentless and heroic efforts to get food to hungry people around the globe.,May God bless the humanitarian workers killed yesterday and comfort their families and loved ones in their grief.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",02-04-24,Statement from President Joe Biden on the Death of World Central Kitchen Workers in Gaza,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/02/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-death-of-world-central-kitchen-workers-in-gaza/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,10:08 A.M. EDT,MODERATOR:  Hi, everyone.  Thanks for joining.  Sorry we’re running a little bit late.  Kirby was giving us a history lesson.,He has a few things here at the top, and then we’ll get through as many questions as we can.,MR. KIRBY:  Good morning, everybody.  Thank you.  So just two things at the top.,First, I want to just take a moment to recognize both Croatia and Albania, important NATO Allies that are now celebrating their 15th anniversary as part of the Alliance.,Over the years, both countries have repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to the Alliance through concrete commitments to its plans to bolster European security, its missions further afield, and through NATO’s partnership for peace.,Both countries have also stood as leaders in their region, showing other countries of the Western Balkans that their aspiration of NATO membership is achievable.,Finally, as you may have seen, the constitutional court in Uganda partially overturned the Anti-Homosexuality Act today.  The United States is deeply concerned about the remaining provisions of that act, which undermine public health, human rights, and Uganda’s international reputation.  And our concerns are particularly around this language that imposes prison sentences for up to 20 years for, quote, “promoting homosexuality,” unquote, and permitting a life sentence for same-sex conduct.,As the President has said time and time again, no one should have to live in constant fear nor be subjected to violence or discrimination.  It’s just plain wrong.,We will continue to work to advance respect for human rights for all the people of Uganda and around the world.,And with that, I think we can take some questions.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our first question will go to Steve with Reuters.,Q    Hey there, John.  Why shouldn’t we conclude that this was, in fact, a deliberate strike on the World Central Kitchen convoy?,MR. KIRBY:  Steve, why should you or why shouldn’t you?  I didn’t —,Q    Why should we not conclude that this was a deliberate strike?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, again, I think I would refer you to Israeli authorities, Steve, to speak to what they have learned and — well, what they have said and what they have learned about this.  I won’t speak for IDF operations one way or the other.,As I said yesterday, they’re investigating it, and we have every expectation — we do expect that they will do a thorough job, a swift job, and that they’ll be transparent about it, what they find.,So all I know is they’ve completed their preliminary investigation.  I think you saw a comment from the Southern Command chief of staff yesterday saying he’s received that and they’re reviewing it.  And it will inform what will become a larger — what they’re calling an independent investigation.,So I think we need to let them investigate and let them read out their conclusions.,Q    And just two more things, John.  Is the U.S. doing a separate investigation rather than relying on the Israeli version of events?,MR. KIRBY:  No, we have no plans to conduct a separate investigation.,Q    And lastly, has Jake Sullivan postponed his trip to Saudi Arabia?  And if so, is this the reason why?,MR. KIRBY:  So, Jake was planning to head to the region this week.  That trip has been postponed.  And when we have more on that to speak to, we’ll do that.  He’s recuperating from a cracked rib, and that has affected his ability to travel a bit.,Q    Cracked rib?,MR. KIRBY:  Cracked rib.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Aamer with the AP.,Q    Hi, John.  President Biden’s statement last night made clear that he believes Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers, and called it a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid has been so difficult.  Will the President ask the Israeli government to take any specific action to rectify what he’s really sort of identified as a core issue?,And more broadly, is there any sort of expected consequences for Israel as a result of this incident?  Thank you.,MR. KIRBY:  Well, again, I think we want to see the investigation, and my answer to Steve stands.  We need to see what they find as a result of this incident.  They have already admitted that that they conducted this strike.  They have already publicly said that they’re at fault for this strike.  And they’re working their way through the specific findings and details.  And I think we need to let them finish that work and speak to it themselves.,So I’m not prepared at this point to speculate about anything we might or might not do.  You know, we’re going to have to wait to see what the investigation says.,I will say a couple of things.  We are still supporting Israel’s ability to defend itself against this still-viable threat.  And that’s going to continue.,And then, I’m sorry, you had a question at the top that I think I blew off.,Q    Just, specifically, if there is anything that the President would like to see done differently, because the statement last night really sort of identified that they haven’t done enough on protecting aid workers.  So how do you fix that?,MR. KIRBY:  Of course — of course, we want to see them do things differently to prevent civilian casualties.  Absolutely.  And that’s been an ongoing conversation that we’ve been having with them for many months, in terms of being more precise, being more targeted, being more cautious.,One of the reasons why we plan to have continued conversations with them about Rafah is because we don’t believe that a major ground operation against those Rafah battalions and — I’m sorry, those Hamas battalions in Rafah — is the right approach.  We believe there’s another way to get after that threat, and we want to share with them some of our views on that.,So, yes, of course we have and will continue to talk to them about how to do things differently, how to do things more efficiently, how to do things more safely, and certainly how to do things in a way that minimizes damage to civilian infrastructure and, of course, civilian lives.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to JJ with Bloomberg.,Q    Hey there.  On Nippon Steel and the Japanese prime minister’s visit to the White House that’s coming up: John, can you share anything on what we might expect from Kishida on the Nippon Steel deal?  Is the White House hoping for any reassurances on that?  Or can you share anything on what the President might share with Japan about the U.S. Steel situation? Thanks.,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, JJ, I’m afraid I’m not going to be very satisfying to you today.  I’m not going to get ahead of that meeting and those discussions.  You’ve seen the President’s comments on the Nippon Steel issue.  I can’t improve upon where his head is in terms of protecting U.S. Steel workers and the American economy.,But the President is very much looking forward to this state visit.  There is an awful lot of important things to talk about with Prime Minister Kishida.  Certainly, our two economies are on that agenda, and I have no question that issues of economic — economy and trade will come up.,That said, there’ll be issues to talk about in terms of the security environment, concerns about the DPRK, concerns about aggressive PRC actions.  There’ll be things to talk about in terms of people-to-people exchanges between our two countries.  And quite frankly, there’ll be plenty of opportunities to talk about how we can continue not only our bilateral cooperation with Japan but our trilateral cooperation between Japan and South Korea.,So, lots on the agenda.  Lots to talk about including, of course, how we can both work together closely with the Philippines.,So, there’s an awful lot there.  And I think I just don’t want to get too far ahead of a particular item like the Nippon Steel thing.,Q    Thank you.  And then, just one other thing.  On Jake Sullivan’s injury, can you say if this was just like a personal fall or something?  Or was he harmed by someone?,MR. KIRBY:  No, this was not — so, yeah, the fact that he’s recovering from this cracked rib is contributing to the postponement.  That’s point one.  Point two is, this was a minor accident of his own.  It was not caused by anybody.  It was not the result of a nefarious act or anything like that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Michael Shear with the New York Times.,Q    Hey, John.  Thank you.  I was going to ask about Jake too.  But I guess if there’s no more that you can tell us — it sounds like maybe like a basketball or some kind of sports injury — but if anything else would be helpful.,But in the meantime, if I could ask about Ukraine.  There is a proposal at NATO to have NATO take over leadership of the Ukraine working group that coordinates the assistance — the military assistance to Ukraine, apparently born out of both a concern of sort of a lack of U.S. leadership, given the Ukraine funding tie-up in Congress, but also the possibility of a return of Donald Trump next year.,Does the U.S. support shifting that leadership over to NATO and the U.S. sort of taking a backseat in directing that money?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, look, I’m not going to get ahead of some — what sounds to me like some preliminary discussions there.  But amongst NATO Allies, they can speak to this.,What I can tell you, though, Mike, is that the Ukraine Defense Contact Group has been critical in bringing together 50-some-odd countries to contribute to Ukraine’s security assistance needs.  And that was really an idea that was born from Secretary Austin and that he has convened now more than a dozen times, really, the result of American convening power, and an example of how President Biden has really revitalized our leadership on the world stage to bring countries together to do this.,We think it’s important.  And it is bigger than NATO.  It’s bigger than the Alliance.  As I said, 50-some-odd countries around the world.  And what brought them together was American leadership.  The President believes that that leadership remains vital, remains important.  And he’s confident that we’re going to be able to continue to demonstrate that leadership through the contact group.,Q    So it sounds like you guys would not support shifting that leadership.  Or am I reading too much?,MR. KIRBY:  Again, I’m not going to speculate about some hypothetical conversations that some NATO Allies may or may not be having.,The contact group has been very, very effective.  We’re going to continue to lead and convene it.  And we know that our leadership of that contact group is valued, it’s important.  We get terrific feedback from all the nations that are participating in it.,I want to just make two points.  Let me foot-stomp them.  First one, I’ve already said, is that it is bigger than NATO.  It’s 50-some-odd nations all around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific.  And what brought them together was American leadership.  What’s keeping them together is American leadership.,And the second point I want to make is that NATO has been a part of that process since the beginning.  Jens Stoltenberg, he’s attended every single one of them, including the first one.,So we certainly value the contributions of the Alliance proper but also individual Alliance members in the contact group.  And we would certainly expect that to continue.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Missy Ryan with the Washington Post.,Q    Hi.  Thank you.  Just wanted to ask, John, if there’s any update to the timing of the rescheduled in-person visit from the Israeli delegation.,And then ask you, looking ahead to the visit by the Iraqi prime minister, are you all expecting any sort of finalization of the mil-to-mil talks in terms of the — or announcement regarding a changed U.S military posture in Iraq during that visit?,MR. KIRBY:  Thanks, Missy.  On the Israeli delegation, I think we’re hoping to get an in-person meeting on the books next week.  We’ll have more detail for you as we get closer to it.,On the prime minister’s visit, we very much see this as a great opportunity to continue discussions with him and his team about the counter-ISIS efforts in Iraq and what that needs to look like going forward.,I would not expect coming out of this visit that it’ll be a decision or meeting in terms of, you know, there’ll be some sort of final conclusion about what that posture looks like going forward.  But, absolutely, we will spend time with him talking about what it needs to look like given the threat that ISIS continues to pose both in Iraq and in Syria.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Weijia with CBS.,Q    Thank you, Sam.  And thank you, John.  Back to the humanitarian strike, John.  Do you know whether any U.S.-supplied weapons or resources were involved to carry out that strike?,MR. KIRBY:  I do not know the answer to that question.,Q    And if you don’t issue an investigation, as you said the U.S. would not, how will you ever know?  And if you don’t ever know, how do you answer to the families, including that of an American who was killed?,MR. KIRBY:  We expect the Israelis to conduct a thorough, comprehensive, complete, and transparent investigation.  We look forward to finding out the results of that investigation.  And we’ll move on from there.,But, my goodness, they just completed a preliminary investigation in, you know, less than 48 hours.  And they’re working their way through that, and that will inform a broader investigation.  And we’ve made clear our expectations for the results of that investigation.  And I don’t think it would behoove any of us to get ahead of it.,Q    And have you set a deadline for Israel to complete that investigation?,MR. KIRBY:  No, we have not.,Q    And an unrelated question.  Last night, President Biden received a letter from an eight-year-old orphan in Rafah from Dr. Ahmad, who attended the meeting last night.  Do you know if the President has had a chance to read the letter and his response to that little girl?,MR. KIRBY:  I do not.  I’ll have to take that question.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to MJ Lee with CNN.,Q    Hey, John.  Just first on the postponed Jake Sullivan trip.  Is this just that he is no longer going, or will other members of the administration travel there, or are they already traveling there without him?,MR. KIRBY:  No, there was going to be a small team that was going to accompany Jake.  And so, nobody is going.  I mean, it was a purposeful trip in that regard.  And again, his injury has contributed to the delay.  And he looks forward to getting it back on schedule as soon as possible.,Q    Okay.  So the whole delegation, they are no longer going, but it will presumably be rescheduled once he is feeling better?,MR. KIRBY:  That is correct.,Q    Okay.  And I was wondering, just back to the aid workers that were killed, can you just help us understand what is stopping the administration from saying the U.S. can no longer support Israel’s current efforts to go after Hamas in the way that it is?  Not that the U.S. no longer supports Israel but that it cannot support the current war that it is waging, given that seven, eight workers, including an American, are dead.  The President says he’s outraged.  And he was pretty explicit last night in saying that Israel is entirely to blame for their deaths.,MR. KIRBY:  I guess I just have to challenge a little bit the premise of the question, MJ.  We have been very clear with the Israelis privately — and, my goodness, we’ve been clear publicly — that the way they are prosecuting their operations is not always, in every case, the best way to do that.  We have said there have been too many civilians killed.  We have talked about the civilian infrastructure that’s been destroyed.  We have been very clear about our concerns and objections over some obstacles that have been put in the way of getting additional humanitarian assistance in.  And nobody is working harder than Joe Biden or this administration on trying to get a ceasefire in place so that we can get the hostages out.,So I just — I guess I’m just going to take issue with, again, the premise of the question.  We have been exceedingly consistent and clear with our expectations for the prosecution of these operations.,Q    Just to be clear, so you are saying you think the administration has already been clear to the Israelis that it does not support Israel’s current efforts in Gaza, the way that it is currently waging this war?,MR. KIRBY:  We have been very clear with the Israelis on the some of the specifics of their operations, some of the specifics regarding getting assistance into Gaza.  And those conversations have happened privately at various levels, including at the President’s level and certainly at staff levels.,Now, I want to make it clear that while we take issue with aspects of how operations are being conducted — particularly like saying, quite frankly, publicly, we don’t support a ground operation in Rafah — we also continue to believe and continue to act on the belief that Israel has a right to defend itself against a still-viable threat by Hamas.  They still have every right and responsibility to their people to eliminate that threat after the 7th of October.  And so, that support for Israel continues.  No country should have to live next door to a threat that is truly genocidal, as Hamas has been.,So while we make no bones about the fact that we have certain issues about some of the way things are being done, we also make no bones about the fact that Israel is going to continue to have American support for the fight that they’re in to eliminate the threat from Hamas.,Q    You said earlier that you would first need to see the results of the investigation before you can speak to what actions the U.S. might take after this incident.  You said yourself, though, that Israel has already said, you know, it was their mistake, it was their fault.  And we already know, of course, that seven people are dead.  So what more do you think the administration could possibly learn from the investigation?,MR. KIRBY:  I think the Israelis want to learn from the investigation.  They want to learn exactly how it happened.  And it’s one thing to be able to admit, and they have, that they perpetrated this attack and that they — and that, obviously, it was not the intended result.  But they, too, want to learn what decisions were made that led to this attack and where the fault lies.,And as I said yesterday, we firmly believe that if accountability needs to be observed, then we want to see accountability observed for people who may have — you know, who may have acted here inappropriately.  But again, we don’t know that.,So we need to let the investigation conclude.  We need to see what they learn.  And we need to see, just as importantly, what they do about what they’ve learned, what changes they’re willing to make, what accountability they’re willing to observe.  We’re just not there yet.  So we need to let them finish their work.,In the meantime, we have made very clear, all the way up to the President’s level, our outrage about this attack and the result of it, of course, and our deep, deep concern about this particular operation.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Justin with ABC.,Q    Hey, good morning, Kirby.  Thanks for doing this.  The Human Rights Watch director told ABC today that the U.S. could be legally complicit in supplying weapons to countries that are blocking aid, speaking about the war in Gaza.  She said, “If you’re helping another party commit grave abuses against civilians, then you risk being complicit in those abuses,” saying that’s “a matter of international law.”  Just wanted to get your response to the director.,MR. KIRBY:  I’m not an international lawyer.  I can tell you that we share the concerns of so many groups out there about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which is why almost — well, not almost; actually, from the beginning of this conflict — and then urging and pushing the Israelis to do more to get humanitarian assistance in to allow the flow into Gaza.  It’s why we’re doing airdrops.  It’s why we got a temporary pier that’s on the way over there to be able to assist with maritime loading of humanitarian assistance and getting that into Gaza.,So we share the concerns over what’s going on inside Gaza with the Palestinian people, and we’re doing everything we can to try to alleviate that.,It’s also why we continue to push for a ceasefire that will allow for the hostages to get out and a period of calm for about six weeks so that more humanitarian assistance can get in.,Again, I’m not a lawyer here, but I would also tell you, as I said yesterday from the podium, the State Department continues to review incidents as they arise.  And as I said yesterday, they haven’t found an incident yet that has pointed to a violation of international humanitarian law.  But they continue to do that work, as they should.,Q    And we also saw the Australian Prime Minister speak directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu following the strike.  Should we expect President Biden to do the same?  And if not, why isn’t he picking up the phone to speak to Netanyahu if an American was killed in this strike?,MR. KIRBY:  The President, as you know, speaks routinely and as appropriate with Prime Minister Netanyahu.  He has spoken to him many times in the past since the 7th of October.  He will speak to him again.  I don’t have a call to speak to or to preview at this time.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Asma with NPR.,Q    Hi there.  Thanks, Kirby.  I had (inaudible) questions.  Yesterday, I know there were a couple of doctors who were at the White House, meeting with the President, who’d recently been inside of Gaza.  And the way they characterized their meeting was that they were — the first time since October 7th that the President had heard from anybody who’s been inside of Gaza.  And I wanted to assess: Is that accurate?  Had the President, prior to yesterday, not spoken to any aid workers or anybody else who had been inside of Gaza since October 7th?,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I’m going to have to take your question.,MODERATOR:  We’re going to go on to our next question.  Morgan with Semafor.,Q    Hey, John.  Thanks so much for doing this.  I have two questions.  Just, first, on the (inaudible) earthquake in Taiwan.  I’m just wondering how worried the White House is about the impact on the chip supply chain and if there’s anything you’re doing to address those concerns.,And then secondly, I know you mentioned yesterday that the President and President Xi talked about TikTok, and I was just wondering if you could say how that came up on the call yesterday.  Did President Xi raise it?  Is that something that President Biden raised?  Just a little more detail there.,MR. KIRBY:  So, on the earthquake, I mean, our first and, frankly, our only concern right now is for the safety and security of people in the region who could be affected by the earthquake and its aftermath.,And we’re in touch with authorities, as you might expect we would be.  We certainly stand by to assist in any way that might be required.  But that’s where our focus is right now, not on follow-on potential economic impact one way or the other, or for high tech.  Our concern is for the lives and livelihoods.  And our thoughts and prayers are with everybody who was affected by the earthquake.  We’ll continue to monitor it as we have overnight.,On TikTok, President Xi raised the issue, and President Biden responded to the concerns that President Xi raised.  And as I said yesterday at the podium, he responded by making it clear to President Xi that this was not about a ban on TikTok, that this was about divestiture, that this was about preserving the data security of the American people and our own national security interests.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Serena with Scripps.,Q    Hey, John.  Thanks so much for doing this.  I wanted to follow up on last night’s meeting at the White House.  Are you going to provide a readout of that in any way?,And are there any plans for the President to speak to the American aid worker that was — family that was killed?,MR. KIRBY:  I don’t know about a readout for the Iftar meeting last night.  I’d refer you to White House Communications on that.  That’s not something that would be handled by the National Security Council.,And, shoot, I forgot your second one.  I meant to write it down and I didn’t.  What was your second one?,Q    Oh, the family of the American aid worker.,MR. KIRBY:  Oh, yes.  As I said yesterday, the State Department has made initial contact with the family.  I think you can understand this is a delicate moment for them.  And, you know, they did express a desire for some time to process the news.  And so, I think we’re going to give them that time.  But obviously, first and foremost, they have the President’s and the First Lady’s condolences.,And as he has in the past, when it’s appropriate, he’ll make the necessary, you know, outreach.  But again, right now, the family is going through a very difficult time, and we want to respect their — we want to respect their privacy and, quite frankly, their grieving process.,Q    Are there any concerns that that strike on the aid workers are going to impact negatively the ceasefire and hostage negotiations that are ongoing?  Is there an update on the proposal that was made to Hamas?,MR. KIRBY:  No, I don’t have an update for you.  I don’t know and I wouldn’t anticipate any particular impact on those discussions as a result of the strike yesterday.  But I also, at the same time, don’t have, again, any progress to report to you.  We’re still working hard at this, trying to get this deal in place.  And we’re going to — we’re going to stay at that work.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Neria with Israel Channel 13.,Q    Hi, Admiral.  Thank you so much for doing this again.  I’m wondering about the meeting — the virtual meeting between the Israelis and Sullivan and the rest of the team here in the U.S. about Rafah.  I do understand that there are a few major gaps between Israel and the U.S., mainly regarding the evacuation of the civilians, but other issues as well.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?,MR. KIRBY:  No.  (Laughs.)  I don’t think that would be useful for me to do in this particular setting, to lay out their views versus our views.  The big muscle movements are the same, Neria, which is that we don’t support a ground operation in Rafah, and we still believe that whatever the Israelis decide to do about Rafah, they’ve got to factor in the 1.5 million refugees that are there.,And we were grateful for the opportunity to have that virtual discussion.  As I said earlier, hopefully in the next week, sometime in the next week, we hope to do an in-person meeting to continue that discussion.,I would look at what happened in the virtual discussion this week as sort of the beginning of that conversation, the beginning of that process of talking to them about what Rafah looks like now and what their intentions are for operations against those Hamas battalions that are still there.,Q    And do you have any news about hostages deal, the negotiations?,MR. KIRBY:  No.  As I said to the previous question, I don’t have an update for you, except to say that we continue to work very, very hard at it.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Danny with AFP.,Q    Hi there.  Thanks for doing this again.  Just going back to the strike on the aid workers in Gaza.  I mean, the statement last night from the President was one of his strongest yet, and he said, you know, that his rhetoric has been getting tougher and tougher on Israel about this kind of thing.  But they just don’t seem to be listening.  I mean, this must be a source of frustration for the President, must it not?,MR. KIRBY:  I think you could sense the frustration in that statement yesterday.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nadia.,Q    Good morning.  Thank you for doing this.  Just a follow-up on what happened on the incident with the World Central Kitchen.,John, you said that you’re waiting for the results of the investigation to conclude, but can you give us an example of when Israel, in the last six months, investigated any incidents and held anybody accountable, whether civilians carrying white flags were killed, whether civilians at the food trucks were killed, whether mass bodies or mass graves that are being reported and not investigated?,Many people believe the reason the Israelis admitted this time is because they caught red-handed because the workers were international members of the World Central Kitchen.  And their government is able to tell that it was an Israeli rocket, and Israelis cannot just basically cloud it and say, “Maybe we don’t know, maybe it’s crossfire, maybe it’s Hamas.”,So how can you say with certainty that all these incidents, that could be by mistake, and yet you don’t have anybody on the ground — you have no U.S. intelligence on the ground — and you always seem to take the Israeli point of view as a fact?,MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, look, Nadia, I mean, that’s not even really a question, to be honest with you.  That is a — that’s a statement that you just made.  And I understand where you’re coming from.,I don’t think you can look at what we’ve been saying, what we’ve been doing, or even the President’s statement last night, and say that we’ve somehow gone easy on Israel in every regard.,Now, you can talk to the Israelis about their individual events; you seem to have reached conclusions about all of them yourself.  So I recommend that you talk to the Israelis about these incidents and see for yourself what their answers are for them.,They have investigated some of these events in the past, and they have — as I’ve said from the podium, they have taken actions in certain regards and in certain ways to limit and to try to be more mindful of civilian casualties.  Is it enough? Absolutely not.  It’s not enough.  And the President said that last night in his statement; there’s been too many civilian casualties.  And the President said in his statement last night that he’s outraged about this attack.,And I have said myself, today and yesterday, that we’re going to see what the investigation says, and then we’ll — you know, we’ll make decisions as a result of that.,But I don’t know how differently to put it.  Israel has a right to defend itself.  Maybe not everybody believes that, but they do.,Q    Oh, I think —,MR. KIRBY:  And maybe not everybody believes — wait a second.  Maybe not everybody believes that they’re living next to a genocidal threat, but they are.,And so, we’re going to continue to support them.  No country should have to live like that.  No country should have to be attacked, like they were on the 7th of October, with 1,200 people slaughtered.,At the same time, as a modern military and a democracy, they have obligations to the innocent people of Gaza.  And they have not always met those obligations.,And the United States, more than any other nation — and you can’t name me another nation, Nadia — that hasn’t also put it directly to the Israelis about concerns about how they have not allowed more humanitarian assistance again, about how they have to be more careful about civilian casualties.  You name me another leader that has been more direct and more consistent than President Biden and this administration.,So, again, I’m sorry, I’m just going to have to take issue with the premise of your statement.  We are working very closely with them.  We will continue to work closely with them to make sure they can defend themselves but also that they do it in a way that is in keeping with the highest standards of the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

law of armed conflict.,Q    John, I just want to put it on the record: Neither me or any of my colleagues ever question the right of Israel to defend itself.  That’s for the record.  So I just wanted to tell you that our questions are always about the methods, not about the right to defend — Israel’s right to defend itself.  Just want to make that clear.,MR. KIRBY:  And my response, Nadia, is that we’re concerned about the methods too.  I don’t know how we can be more clear.  Every single day we’re talking about the way this war is being prosecuted.  And it’s important to us; it matters how they do this.  And that is why we are having these tough conversations with them.  And that is why you’ve heard — you saw it for yourself in the statement that the President issued, you know, his outrage, his frustration over this particular attack as it reflects a culmination of similar events.  I said yesterday it’s not the first time that this has happened.  And so, yes, we’re frustrated by this.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Alex with Politico.,Q    Yeah, thanks, John.  So just, I guess, to put an overall cap on this, it sounds like the administration will not change its approach to Israel after the strike; it’s going to continue as is, the same sort of criticisms and the same sort of,support.  So there’s that.,MR. KIRBY:  Well, wait.  Hang on just second now.,Q    Go ahead.  Go ahead.,MR. KIRBY:  What I said was: We are still supporting their right to defend themselves, and we’re going to continue to do that.  We’re also going to see what the results of the investigation is.  I’m not going to get ahead of decisions that haven’t been made yet.,Q    Okay.  Gotcha.  On the Biden-Xi call, did they discuss anything about the plans to have the trilateral patrols of the South China Sea with the Philippines and Japan?,MR. KIRBY:  No.,Q    Okay.  And last bit.  Did the strike complicate any efforts by the administration to recruit that aid partner to distribute more aid into Gaza from the temporary pier?,MR. KIRBY:  What aid partner are you speaking about, Alex?,Q    Or is the U.S. trying to — isn’t the U.S. trying to recruit somebody to help bring the aid to sort of that last mile?  Or do I have that wrong?,MR. KIRBY:   Oh, okay.  I’m sorry, I didn’t understand your question.,I don’t know of any effect on those efforts at this early time, Alex.  You know, I know that Chef Andrés said he was going to stop for a while.  We know the World Food Program has said that too.  But we’re still discussing the modalities of — well, the maritime effort to get humanitarian assistance in and what that’s going to look like.  And I think, you know, we’re just — it’s just too soon after the strike to know what sort of larger strategic impact this is going to have.,We obviously are going to do everything we can to work towards the continued delivery of humanitarian assistance at an increased level.  So while we certainly understand why some aid organizations would have qualms about this — certainly within their rights to do that, given what happened; no question about it — but it’s not going to stop or lessen our efforts to do what we can to increase the flow of aid.  That’s, again, while our airdrops continue, while we’re working on this temporary pier, all that is indicative of our effort to try to increase the flow.,And I want to come back, if I can, to foot-stomping that that’s why we’re working so hard on this temporary ceasefire — to get some security, some calm in place, not only so that the hostages can move safely home and out but so that more aid can get in and around.,One of the challenges of humanitarian assistance — and there are many — is, in fact, the combat operations themselves.  It’s a war zone.  And it’s difficult to move trucks around inside a combat zone and particularly a confined urban environment like that.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  I think we have time for one more question, so we’ll go to James Rosen.,Q    Samantha, thank you.  Admiral, thank you.  Thank you both, as always.  Since we hear and see so little of each other these days, I was hoping you might indulge three questions from me, in keeping with the multiple-question format employed by some of the reporters on the call.  I have in mind three different topics.  At least two of them can be addressed through simple yes-or-no answers.,First, on the Mideast, is it the assessment of NSC that the airstrikes the U.S. conducted earlier this year against the Houthis and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq succeeded in establishing deterrence in the region?,MR. KIRBY:  Well, what we believe is that these attacks have definitely degraded Houthi capabilities.  Have they eliminated them?  No.  And the Houthis still conduct attacks.,I want to make it clear though, at the front, James — and you don’t have to look any further than the Secretary of Defense, who made this more clear than I — this is about, and has been from the beginning, about taking away capability from the Houthis.  That’s the purpose of it.,Q    Second question.  Can you confirm that no facet or component of the national security apparatus, including but not limited to investigations on masking or surveillance in any form, is presently trained or focused on any current American political campaign?,MR. KIRBY:  I am not sure how to answer that question.  Are you suggesting or you’re asking —,Q    I’ll repeat it, if that would help.,MR. KIRBY:  — is the intelligence community spying on a political candidate?,Q    Correct.  Can you confirm that no facet or component of the national security apparatus is presently trained or focused on any current American political campaign?,MR. KIRBY:  This is a question beyond the NSC’s purview.  But just to put a fork in it, there’s no spying on a political candidate.,Q    Lastly, on TikTok, which examples should Americans regard as a model for them to follow: that of the Biden administration, which has banned TikTok from federal devices, or that of the Biden campaign, which makes active use of TikTok?,MR. KIRBY:  The President has been very clear about this.  Because of —,Q    I don’t think it’s very clear, John.  I think it’s very confused messaging.,MR. KIRBY:  Well, so if you just let me finish, maybe we can help clear this up.,TikTok’s ownership by ByteDance gives us pause and reason to be concerned about the security of data on that application and the use of that data by a company that has close ties to the Chinese Communist Party.,We don’t want to ban the application.  We want divestiture of the ownership of the company so that Americans, and certainly inside the national security establishment, we can take a measure of comfort that that data is not going to be mishandled.  That is very consistent.  That’s what we’ve been doing.,I’m not going to speak for the campaign.  I can only speak for the National Security Council and speak for the President in the context of the National Security Council.  And from that perspective, we have been nothing but consistent.,Q    Well, can’t you understand how Americans might be confused when they see a chief executive who declares the use of this platform a national security problem, and a candidate, in the very same person, who makes active use of that platform?  You can understand why Americans might be confused about that, can’t you?,MR. KIRBY:  I never make the mistake of trying to speak for the American people or trying to claim that I understand what they are or are not confused about.,All I can tell you — and I’m not confused about this — is that there are significant national security concerns about that application on government devices, which is why we’re not allowed to use it on government devices.,And number two, that is why the President continues to want to see a divestiture of the company so that it’s not owned by ByteDance, so that the Chinese Communist Party is not in control of the data that TikTok is able to assemble on its users.,And I think that that — there’s reassurance there if, in fact, we can move towards that divest issue.,MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And as always, if we weren’t able to get to you, hit up the distro and we’ll try to get back to you as quick as possible. Thanks, everyone.,10:51 A.M. EDT,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington," DC 20500""",03-04-24,On-the-Record Press Gaggle by White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/04/03/on-the-record-press-gaggle-by-white-house-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-8/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Statements and Releases,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,The Republican Study Committee, which represents 100% of House Republican leadership and about 80% of their members, released a budget that would severely cut critical funding for states to respond to the overdose epidemic.,More Americans between the ages of 18 and 49 die from opioid overdoses than any other cause. President Biden believes we should come together as Americans to do everything we can to fight the opioid crisis that is devastating millions of families in every state and community across the country. That’s why the President has made beating the opioid epidemic,a key priority in his Unity Agenda for the Nation,and has called on Republicans and Democrats to work together to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and expand access to life-saving treatment for addiction.,Under President Biden’s,leadership,, the Biden-Harris Administration has invested more funding and broken more barriers to treatment than any previous administration. That includes signing the bipartisan law that expanded the number of health care providers who can prescribe life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder by more than 1.8 million. And it includes fighting for the toughest, fairest bipartisan border security legislation in modern history to help strengthen our ability to stop fentanyl trafficking at the border.,In contrast, about 80% of House Republicans recently proposed a budget that would cut critical investments in families and communities by over 30 percent. That would include slashing funding for State Opioid Response Grants – the primary way the federal government helps states and territories fight the opioid epidemic. At a time when more than 27 million Americans had a drug use disorder in 2022, and when we are losing one American to drug overdose every five minutes, House Republicans are proposing to rip away life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder. These cuts,are on top of the $4.5 trillion,they want to cut from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which would throw millions off their coverage and cut services for many more, including people who depend on these programs for mental health and substance use disorder care.,The State Opioid Response grant program provides critical funding for states and territories to increase access to medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder, and strengthen prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services for substance use disorder. Through this program, states have been able to provide treatment services to over 1.2 million people across the country since 2018. States have also been able to purchase approximately 10 million overdose reversal medication kits and reverse more than 550,000 overdoses using these grant funds.,But under House Republicans’ latest budget proposal, nearly 39,000 fewer Americans across the country would be served by this critical program:,This analysis assumes an across-the-board reduction of roughly 31% compared to the currently enacted FY 2024 levels for non-defense discretionary (NDD) accounts. This aligns with the Republican Study Committee Budget, which would cut NDD base funding to $534 billion in FY 2025, a roughly 31% reduction from the funding provided in the enacted FY 2024 bills.,###,We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.,Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.,The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500",03-04-24,FACT SHEET: House Republicans Propose Severely Undermining Fight Against Opioid Crisis in Latest Extreme Budget Proposal,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/03/fact-sheet-house-republicans-propose-severely-undermining-fight-against-opioid-crisis-in-latest-extreme-budget-proposal/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Speeches and Remarks,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,Indian Treaty Room,12:00 P.M. EDT,THE PRESIDENT:  Kris, thank you, thank you, thank you.  First of all, thank you for the courage you’ve shown over the years dealing with your health issues but also for standing up here before the whole nation and explaining to us what you’ve gone through.  It’s not easy to do.,You know, trying to afford your expensive medications, from blood disorders to asthma — millions of Americans — millions — have similar stories: lying in bed at night literally staring at the ceiling wondering what in God’s name will happen if their spouse gets cancer of if their child gets sick or something happens to them.  Are they going to have enough insurance?  Can they afford the medical bills they’re going to have?  Will they have to sell the house to keep things moving?,You know, and you find out a big reason why we’re lying awake at night with these questions is because the drug companies are charging exorbitant — exorbitant prescription drug prices — higher prices than anywhere in the world.,When Bernie said it — I was listening in the back, Bernie.  You and I have been fighting this for 25 years.  Finally — finally we beat Big Pharma.  Finally.  (Applause.)  I’m serious.,I’m proud — (laughs) — I’m proud that my administration is taking on Big Pharma in the most significant ways ever.,And I wouldn’t have done it without Bernie.  And Bernie got a — you know, look, Bernie was the one who was leading the way for decades in which we’re — why we’re here today.,You know, Bernie mentioned that Americans pay more for prescription drugs than other advanced nation in the world.,If you want to — if you walk into a local drugstore here in America, the prices are at least two to three times more for the exact same prescription made by the exact same pharmaceutical company in Canada, France, Italy, and even in Eastern Europe — all around the world.  But not anymore.,For years, people have talked about how Medicare has the power to negotiate for lower drug price — prescription drug prices the government pays for, just like the VA does when they’re able to negotiate medicines and — and needs for the veterans.,But we’ve tried and tried and tried.  And finally, with Bernie’s help, I finally got my Inflation Reduction Act, which passed — and Bernie helped get it passed.  Not one Republican in the entire Congress — this — this did surprise me; I have to admit to you — not one single Republican voted for it — not one single one — to give us authority to take on and beat Big Pharma.,Take insulin for people with diabetes — it costs 10 bucks to make.  If you add everything in terms of packaging and all the rest, you can argue maybe $12 total.  And they’re charging as much as $400 a month.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Seniors with diabetes will only have to pay $35 a month from this point on.  (Applause.),And, by the way, when I first got the law passed, guess what?  It applied to every American — every American.  But the Republicans were able to cut back on the fact that only — they only were not able — the only thing they couldn’t defeat was seniors.,But I want to — I want those savings to be for every — every single person in America, no matter what their age.  No one should pay more than 35 bucks a month for insulin, period.,And, by the way, drug companies still make a significant pro- — product — I’m — excuse me, significant profit because I said: Ten bucks to make.  By the way, the guy who invented the drug didn’t want to patent it because he wanted it available to everybody.  Well, it’s available all right.,Look, folks, there’s a whole lot of prescription drugs that are ongoing — undergoing the process of lower pricing.,Medicare is now able to negotiate lower drices — lower prices for some of the costliest drugs that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis.,This year alone, the law that’s already passed — it’s in the law now that we signed — Medicare is negotiating,10 of the most costly drugs next year, and they’ll do that every year beyond for the — it goes well beyond 50 drugs.,Next year, it’ll be 15.  It isn’t just saving seniors money.  Along with other reforms, it’s taxpayer money and we’re cutting the federal deficit.  And people say, “Well, it’s costing money.”  Guess what?  It’s costing the drug companies money.,It cuts the deficit by $160 billion — $160 billion.  (Applause.)  No, I’m serious.  Think about it.  Over the next 10 years — because Medicare will no longer have to be — pay those exorbitant prices.  Instead of paying 400 bucks, they’re paying 35 bucks.,But I think we should be more aggressive.  It’s time to negotiate lower prices for at least 50 drugs a year.  We only have it — the law only requires 10 now, and then 15, and it moves up.,Along with other actions, we’re not only saving lives, but if we move that number up, we’ll save taxpayers another $200 billion on top of the $160 billion, because Medicare will not be paying these exorbitant costs.,It is a gigantic — and, by the way, the other guy talks about cutting the deficit.  He increased the deficit more than any president has in history.  And we’ve cut it.,Look, in addition to the law we passed that will cap prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare starting in 2025 — it’s already the law — doesn’t require anything else — because when I say these things, they say, “You think you can get it done?”  It’s already the law.,Every- — your drugs will not cost you — if you’re a senior on Medicare — will not have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what the drugs costs.  And as you know — many of you unfortunately know or your parents — some of the cancer drugs cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 a year.  Combined — combined, they will not have to pay a penny beyond $2,000 a year.  (Applause.)  And the drug companies will still make a lot of money.,Folks, Bernie and I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for every American, not just seniors.  (Applause.),We’re here today to talk about how we’re lowering prices and cracking down on un- — unfair competition in prescription drugs.,I’m a capitalist.  Capitalism, though, without competition isn’t capitalism;  it’s exploitation.  That’s what’s going on: exploitation.,When Big Pharma doesn’t play by the rules, competitors can’t offer lower prices for generic drugs and devices that carry that medication, so prices are raised artificially.  I thank Bernie for leading the charge to do something about this.,For example, asthma is one of the most common respiratory illnesses in America.  Twenty-seven million Americans have asthma, including four million children.  Asthma causes about one thou- — one million visits to a hospital emergency rooms every year.,Nationwide, the cost of treating asthma is estimated to be $50 billion a year — the treating the asthma — not the drug, treating the asthma.,If you have asthma, you will likely need an inhaler to breathe.  Now this spring is here, the season and allergies are on — upon us.  We’re on the rise even more.  More people with asthma need inhalers to breathe.,You know, many asthma medications — many have — be on the market for more than 25 years.  They cost less than $5 to make.  They cost less than $5 to make, but the medication — the medication hasn’t changed at all.,Theoretically, if the drug company came with a new medicine that would — they invested in a lot of money to find a better way, they di- — they wouldn’t have to — they could argue that — another price.  But drug companies have increased prices for asthma drugs up to eight times more than the original cost.  And the mechanism is- — and the m- — the mechanisms attached to the inhaler, the thing that makes it, you know, go into your — into your nose or mouth, that is a device that Med- — Medicare hasn’t changed much either.,Look, these big companies try to keep generic companies away from getting patents on devices that deliver the medication through the inhalers.,So, there’s two pieces.  It’s not just the — what’s in the inhaler.  It’s the mechanism that allows it to go into your body.,For example, they slightly changed the cap of an inhaler and they use the new patent on that cap to block generic drug companies from being able to enter the market.  It’s a big deal.  Playing these games with patients and pricing, Big Pharma is able to charge Americans significantly higher prices and pad their profits.,Senator Sanders has pointed out one company sells an inhaler for 49 bucks in the United Kingdom.  You know how much they charge in the United States for that one inhaler?  Six hundred and forty-five dollars.  So, I take — $645.,If you need that inhaler and you get on Air Force One with me, the next time we go to London, you can get off and you can get it for — (laughter) — no, I’m serious.  Think about that, though.  Just think about that.  For the same exact medicine and the same exact device.  It’s outrageous.,Another company sells an inhaler for $9 in Germany — $9 in Germany — and we pay $286 here in the United States.  Nine bucks in Germany — same outfit, same company, same device — and it’s 30 times more.  Thirty times more.  I repeat: It’s outrageous.  And we’re doing something about it, finally.,Why in God’s name should an American pay $645 for the same inhaler sold in the United Kingdom for $49 by the same outfit — the same outfit?,Bernie called out the drug companies during the congressional hearings.  And you just heard from Lina Khan, the Federal — the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, who is working with the Food and Drug Administration to crack down on these drug companies, and it’s a big deal.,As a result of all this action, some drug companies have withdrawn their abusive patent listings for inhalers and other common products like EpiPens.,You know, the last few weeks, some of the big drug companies have gotten the message to reduce the prices for some asthma drugs.  Bernie is a big reason why that’s happened.  In fact, three of the four largest companies are capping the cost of inhalers for many patients — that can be up to $600 out of pocket — at $35.  There’s some progress going on beyond what we’ve done — the law.  But it’s about time.,And — and going forward with more competition and more generic drugs in the market, the price could be even less than it is now and coming down.,But that’s not all.  Because of all of you, my Inflation Reduction Act — drug companies that raise prices more than inflation are going to pay back Medicare the difference between what they charged and the inflation rate.  This is based on the price of their drugs in 2021.,That means consumers will pay less for prescription drugs, and they’ll save taxpayers money and discourage companies from hiking prices faster than inflation in the first place.  But we want to do more.,It’s time the drug companies pay rebates when they increase prices faster than inflation — not just for seniors but for every single American — every single American.  (Applause.),And today’s announcement follows actions we’ve already taken to significantly reduce the healthcare costs for average Americans.  We took action to reduce the cost of hearing aids for millions of Americans by as much as $3,000 for a pair of hearing aids.,In addition, my administration is banning junk fees on health insurance plans.  These are the plans that stick consumers with big unexpected charges instead of covering the care they need.,Look, they ended up with fair surpri- — I ended up- — surprise medical bills so hospitals that are in-network can’t send you a bill for an out-of-network doctor that you didn’t choose or you would — haven’t even been consulted.  I was in the hospital for a while years ago and that happened.,Kamala and I are protecting and expanding the Affordable Healthcare Act, known as Obamacare, which, I might add, is still a big deal.   (Applause.),Today — thank God my mother wasn’t here — (laughter) — today, 21 million Americans are covered through the Affordable Care Act, 9 million more than when I took office.,I exact tax credits — we enacted tax credits to save an average of $800 per person per year, reducing healthcare premiums for millions of working families whose coverage — who have coverage under the Affordable Care Act.,Those tax credits, though, expire.  You can only get it for — through this year.  And I’m calling on Congress to make tax credits permanent — permanent for this process.  (Applause.),And, folks, all of our progress is in stark contrast to my predecessor and MAGA Republicans in — in the Congress.  They want to, quote — I love their word they love — they want to “terminate” the Affordable Care Act — I love it, “terminate” –my — as my predecessor says, kicking millions of Americans off their health insurance.,And, by the way, the vast majority of these people would not be able to get insurance because they have a preexisting condition.,They also want to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, eliminate the savings to lower prescription drug prices, and so much more.,During the last administration, my president ex- — my predecessor exploded the national debt more than any previous president in the history in a four-year term — more than any prev- — he talks about the debt.  He exploded it more than any other president in a four-year term with his $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly — overwhelmingly benefitted the very wealthy and the biggest corporations in America.,Now he and his Republicans in Congress want to cut Social Security — raise the age — and cut Medicare while they cut taxes for the very wealthy again.,You know, I got a better idea.  I’m going to protect Social Security and Medicare, along with Bernie and other members of Congress, to make sure the wealthy begin to pay their fair share to keep these programs solvent.  (Applause.)  It’s not hard.,And let me repeat what I said that even some people, like Bernie, didn’t like at the beginning — and I don’t blame them — but I said on day one, to make a point: No one in America will pay a single penny more in federal taxes if they make under — less than — if they make less than $400,000 a year.,I wish I was able to do that.  I was listed — and Bernie will — used to kid me about it — I was listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years.  I didn’t think I was poor.  I got a good salary.  But I was the poorest man in Congress.,Trump brags about he is the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned.  And here’s his quote: “I did something no one thought possible.  I got rid of Roe v. Wade.”  End of quote.,And now he and his MAGA officials are calling on a nat- — for a national ban on the right to choose in every state.,I promise you: With a Democratic Congress, Kamala and I will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.  I promise you.  (Applause.),I’m talking too long here.  Let me close with this.  (Laughter.)  I’m excited about this.  I’m really proud of what we’ve been able to do.  I really am.,Bernie and I have been doing this work for a long time.  I know we don’t look it, but we’ve been doing it a long time.  (Laughter.)  Bernie and I have something else in common: We both married way above our stations.,But any rate, but we know we’ve made historic progress in the last three years: 35 bucks for insulin for seniors, $35 for inhalers for asthma, $2,000 a year total cap on costs for seniors.,We’re lowering the cost of some of the most expensive prescription drugs for seniors.,And what I want to do next — what we want to do next is these caps on costs for everyone — everyone, not just seniors.,With Bernie’s help, we’re showing how healthcare ought to be a right and not a privilege in America.  And that’s why I’ve never been more optimistic about — I really mean it.  You’ve heard me say in this very room how optimistic I am.  I am optimistic because the laws we got passed are now coming into effect, whether it’s the infrastructure or whether it’s this.  I mean, there’s so much more.,I just have — we have to — and I said this many times and I’ll get out of your hair.  You know, we have to remember who we are.  We’re the United States of America.,I mean — I mean these things from the bottom of my heart.  We’re the United — there is nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.  We’re the only nation — as a student of history — that I can find that’s come out of every crisis we’ve entered stronger than we went in.  Every single time.  So, let’s remember who the hell — we’re the United States of America.,God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  (Applause.),12:17 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Press Briefings,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,12:58 P.M. EDT,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everyone.,Q Good afternoon.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.  I have one thing at the top, and then we’ll get into Q&A.,I’ll start by sharing some more information on the President’s — on the President’s event earlier today with Senator Bernie Sanders.,Twenty-seven million Americans have asthma, including 4 million kids.  The reality is, the price of inhalers is way too high for too many Americans.,Families can pay anywhere between $200 and $600 for inhalers without insurance, despite the fact that it costs less than five bucks to make an inhaler.,That is why, last year, the Federal Trade Commission and the FDA announced efforts to crack down on falsely claimed patents and increase competition of inhalers to lower costs.,As a result of this administration’s actions, one inhaler manufacturer removed patents from a regulatory list.,Last month, three of the four largest inhaler manufacturers announced that they will cap the cost of inhalers for many patients at 35 bucks per month.,This is on the top of our work — this is on top of our work to lower the cost of prescription drugs through the President’s Inf- — Inflation Reduction Act, which every single congressional Republican opposed.,Thanks to the law, Medicare can now negotiate lower drug prices for American families.,But President Biden wants to expand those efforts by applying the $2,000 cap on prescription drug costs and 35 bucks for insulin to all Americans.,This work to deliver lower healthcare costs is in stark contrast to what congressional Republicans have proposed.  They are still working to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and gut Medicaid.  And they just released a budget that would lead to devastating cuts to Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, increased housing costs and prescription drug costs for families, and huge giveaways for the wealthy and the biggest corporations.,President Biden has been clear: This will not happen on his watch.  The Biden-Harris administration will continue working with partners, like Bernie Sanders, to de- — to deliver results for the American people.,With that — all right.  Good to see you.,Q Hi.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good to see you.,Q Thank you.  Good to see you too.  Two questions, starting with the earthquake in Taiwan.  Has the government there asked for anything yet from the United States?  And will the U.S. coordinate with China if Taiwan does request any kind of assistance?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, what I will say is that we continue to closely monitor the earthquake impacting Taiwan.  And we certainly pray for all those who are affected.  And we are — we are — we are standing by — the United States is standing by on the ready for any necessary assistance.  I don’t have anything else to provide beyond that.  But we’re closely monitoring, and we are ready to assist.,Q Is there any reason to believe at this point that the earthquake will affect the visits next week by the leaders of Japan and the Philippines for the summit?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, don’t have any change of schedule.,QAnd then, lastly — sorry, I know I said two, but I have a third.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it’s okay.  It’s all right, Darlene.,QDoes the President think the meeting he had last night with Muslim leaders was useful?  And is there any reaction or comment on a Palestinian American doctor walking out in the middle of that meeting?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, let me just say a couple of things just at the top about last night and how important it is.  As you know, the President and the Vice President — they continued their tradition of honoring the Muslim community during Ramadan by hosting a meeting with Muslim community leaders to discuss issues of importance to the community.,Let’s not forget, this is a — the sit-down conversation, the meeting was asked and it was supposed — it’s supposed to be private.  They wanted a private meeting.  That was something that, as we have done our outreach — as you know, senior White House officials have been doing this outreach.  The President and the Vice President have been in communication with the community regularly since October.  And this is something that they asked — they asked for a private meeting — a working meeting, if you will.,And so, we understand what’s — how this community is feeling.  It is deeply painful moment for many in the Arab and Muslim communities.,The President also expressed his commitment to continue working to secure an immediate ceasefire as part of a deal to free the hostages and significantly increase humanitarian aid into Gaza.  And the President made clear that he mourns the loss of every innocent life in this conflict, Palestinian and Israeli.,The President and Vice President committed — are committed to continue engaging with these leaders moving forward.  As I mentioned, we have had regular engagement with members of those communities.,As it relates to the — the part of the question that you just asked me about a participant walking out, look, I want to be really careful here.  We said that we would keep this — these conversations private.  So, I’m not going to continue — I’m not going to comment on a — any private discussions.,But as I said many times from this podium, the President respects an American — any American’s right to peacefully protest.  And we’re going to continue to have these conversations, obviously, with that community.,Go ahead, Nancy.,Q Thank you.,Q Thanks, Karine.  How did the White House decide who would attend the iftar dinner?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, what I will say is — want to be careful here.  You know, this meeting, again, was decided, after we had done the outreach for some time now.  We wanted to make sure that this was a private meeting and that participants had an opportunity to be — you know, to be — to be honest and to be able to share their thoughts and feelings about how — you know, how — where they are, how they feel about the situation happening, obviously, in the Middle East.,I don’t have a — a process to lay out how the list came about, and so I, you know, don’t have anything to — to lay out in that realm.,But as you know and as I’ve — as I’ve stated a couple of times, we’ve done outreach for this past several weeks, several months to the Muslim, to the Arab community, Palestinian community and — and heard from them directly.  And they spoke; we listened.  And we hope that they feel like they had an opportunity to express themselves and had an opportunity, in front of the President and the Vice President, to talk about an incredibly painful time.,Q Was last night the President’s first opportunity to speak face to face with someone who had been on the ground providing aid in Gaza?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I can’t speak to the different — the different leaders who have been in this meeting.  It is a private meeting.  We want to make sure that we give folks the opportunity to feel that they have some — you know, some — that they know that they can speak and — and just be clear to us and — and have that — and be — know that it is — those conversations are in confidence.,So, don’t want to read out who’s been in the meeting or — or any specifics in that realm.  I’m going to let them — I’m going to let folks who — if folks who attended want to speak to that and — they can.,What I can say is we’ve had multiple conversations, whether it’s senior — senior officials from the White House, whether it’s this pra- — this President.  We — not all conversations we — we, obviously, read out.  We keep o- — we try to keep these private conversations in private.,I don’t have a list of — of folks of — of, you know, who — who they are or where they come from, if they’ve been to Gaza.  That is something I want to be super mindful of.,Q What was the President’s reaction to the fact that the doctor decided to leave the dinner?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s very — very similar to what I said to Darlene.  The President respects — he respects, you know, any individual, any American, for them to peacefully protest.  He understands that this is a — a painful moment for — for many Americans across the country.,And so, he respects their — their freedom to peacefully protest.  I don’t have anything — you know, I don’t anything outside of that.  They have a right to peacefully protest.  And we’re going to continue to respect that.,Go ahead, Jordan.,Q Thanks, Karine.  Do you — does the administration expect there to be an emergency funding package for the Key Bridge in Baltimore to be announced before the President visits the city on Friday?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, the Department of Transportation just last week announced $60 million to be able to put forward in — in — in building — having to rebuild that bridge.  I don’t have anything outside of — of additional funding.,The President has been very, very clear: He wants to make sure that we — we make the community of Baltimore whole again.  And he has said that the federal government will cover — will certainly cover the bridge being built.,Our focus right now, outside of the — rebuilding that bridge, is making sure that the ports are open, making sure that we continue to do that recovery, clean out — clean out that area.,And so, that’s been the focus.  The President is going to go on Friday.  He will see himself.  We’ll have more information of — of what’s — what’s going on on the ground.  But he gets regular updates, you know, and I think that’s important as well.,Our hearts go out to the lives that were lost during that — that evening — or that early morning.  It’s a sad — obvi- — sad, sad news.  And we are with the families who are mourning — who are mourning their lost ones at this time.,QAnd then on Ukraine.  The White House issued a statement yesterday that was dismissive of Speaker Johnson’s idea to tie that package to the policy banning future LNG exports.  You know, it said that the President wants the aid package passed right away —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q– and that you support the LNG export ban.  But can you clarify whether that means you’re — you’re ruling out that proposal from Speaker Johnson?  Like, is that off the table or — or is this something that you might consider down the road?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, we’ve been very clear, right?  We’ve been very clear.  The reporting, we have said — as you said, from our statement — is not true.  We’ve been really clear about House Republicans should pass the bipartisan national security agreement that already pla- — passed with overwhelming support out of the Senate — 70 to 29.  You’ve heard me say that many times before.,We need to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against Russia’s aggression.  We’re going to continue to be clear about that.,And there is a way to get Ukraine what they need.  All the Speaker has to do is put that national security supplemental on the floor.,The President supports the pause on pending — which is on pending ob- — obviously, additional approvals of L- — LNG export licenses to evaluate the economic and climate impacts on consumers and communities.  He supports that pause.,And there is a way — there is a way to deal with what Ukrainians are fighting for right now.  They’re fighting for their democracy.  They’re fighting for their freedom against the aggression of Mr. Putin.  There’s a way to get them the assistance that they need, and that is to pass that bipartisan — we believe that would be a bipartisan support — national security supplemental that got bipartisan support.,If he puts it on the floor, we know — we know for a fact that Republicans will vote for it.  We know where Democrats stand.  He needs to put that on the floor.,Go ahead, Gabe.,Q Karine, the meeting yesterday was a scaled-back event, as we understand it.  What does — or how troubling is it to the White House that prominent Arab American leaders are declining to come to the White House?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, you know, want to be really clear.  And we’ve been saying this many times before.  Number one, we’ve don- — we’ve done these outreach.  We listened.  The community wanted to have what we thought — change the format, do a meeting where it was a working meeting.  We respected that.  We listened to them and we had a working meeting.  And so, want to be really respectful of that.,And, look, we understand it’s a very painful time.  We understand that.  And we respect that.,And so, look, I — I can’t speak to individuals who want to attend, not want to attend.  That’s for them to speak to.  The President is going to continue to — and his administration, obviously — senior officials are going to continue to have these conversations.  We’re going to continue to listen to the community.  That’s what a president does.  And that’s what this President will — will continue to do.,Q I know the President spoke with Chef José Andrés.  Does the President agree with Chef Andrés that Israel is using food as a weapon?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we understand how Chef Andrés is feeling.  Right?  He just lost members of his team — I’m sure who felt like family to him as well.  The op-ed was very powerful.  What he does is heroic — not just in Gaza, around the world — providing food, providing that essential humanitarian assistance.,And we — you know, you heard from the President last night in his statement.  He — it is — he’s outraged, and he’s heartbroken.  We are all heartbroken here by those seven lives lost.,And so, we are going to continue to mourn with them — with — with the — with Chef José Andrés and, obviously, the families.,I’m just not going to — he’s going to speak for himself.  We are very clear about where we stand.  I think the President’s statement was incredibly powerful, impactful, and really, truly lays out where — how he feels about the current situation.,Q And on another topic, Karine.  How worried is the White House about bird flu?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, this is something that we are certainly monitoring.  We have been — CDC has been certainly working on — on top — working — working and focusing on this.  You know, we take health and safety of the American people seriously.  It is very important to this President.  Our top priority is to keep communities healthy, safe, and informed.,We are closely tracking this, monitoring this, as I just stated, of the reports that are out there and have active, relevant agencies to coordinate with and support local authorities.,The CDC has said the risk to human health from this outbreak is low.  They are continuing to monitor and will continue to coordinate with relevant agencies and officials.  This is — when it comes — again, when it comes to the public health of the American people, we take that very seriously.  And we’ll continue to track this.,Q And, finally, what’s the White House’s response to some on the left who think that Justice Sotomayor should retire so that the President could appoint her replacement?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — I’ve been asked this question before here at the podium.  And when it comes to those types of decision — decisions, those are personal decisions.  That is — regardless if it’s Justice Sotomayor or any other Just- — Justice on the bench, that is for them to make.  That is a decision for that Justice to make.,Again, it’s a personal decision.  That is not something that we get involved in.  But it is something for, obviously, any Justice on the bench — they are — they should be given the space and the freedom to make that decision.  I — I don’t have anything else to say beyond that.,Go ahead, Selina.,Q Thanks, Karine.  How is Israel going to conduct that investigation into the strike that killed those World Central Kitchen aid workers?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we — you heard from the President last night.  You heard from my colleague at — from the National Security Council yesterday and also earlier today.,I think the President’s statement was very, very strong — right? — very straightforward.  He wants to — he wants to see a — a investigation that’s swift, an investigation that’s comprehensive, that has — that brings accountability.  And he wants to make sure that it is made public.,We leave it to, obviously, the Israeli government to do that investigation.  But we want to make sure that it’s swift, it’s comprehensive, that it’s made public.  And it is important.  We need to get to — certainly get to the bottom of exactly what happened.,Q Can you explain what that would entail, a kind of investigation like this?  This is a strike that happened in an active warzone.  Can you give us some detail on what it looks like?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, IDF said they have an ongoing investigation.  It’s underway.  I think that’s important.,We’ve called for this investigation to happen.  I think that’s important.  We wanted to see it happen in a swift manner.  We want to make sure that the findings are public and that there is accountability.,I want to be ma- — very careful here.  I’m not going to get ahead of that process.  There is a process underway.  I believe my NSC colleague mentioned that they have some initial findings.  It’s preliminary.,And so, that process is going to continue.  I’m going to let that process go underway and — and — and let — let the Israeli government speak to that.,Q Right.  But for the sake of transparency, can you explain what that process is and if the U.S. is confident in that process?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we’re not — I’m not going to get into hypotheticals.  I’m not going to get into that partic- — a particular process here.,We want to see something that is comprehensive, we want to see something that leads to accountability, we want to see it be swift, and we want to make sure that it is made available to the public.,That’s what — that’s what the Israeli government — that’s what Prime Minister Netanyahu said he’s going to do.  And we’re going to let that process flow.  We’re going to let that process happen.,Q So, Kirby said earlier today that they’re hoping to get in the books a meeting in person next week with an Israeli delegation.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q Can you provide any more details on that and who might come?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to provide any details on that.  What I can say is — basically, from the readout, is that the expectation is to have a meeting in person.  I think it was important that there was a virtual meeting that occurred, obviously, on Monday to talk about the Rafah operations.,We’ve been very clear where we stand on this — very clear.  We believe there has to be alternative ways to deal with Hamas in — in Gaza.  As we are — specifically in — in Rafah, a military operation in — we believe is not the way to move forward.,There is a active conversations happening with the Israeli government and obviously our government, and I think that’s important.,I’m not going to go into details from here.  As you — as you heard from us, as you heard from my colleague, there’s going to be hopefully next week an in-person meeting, and we’re looking forward to continuing those really critical, important conversations.,Go ahead.,Q Do you anticipate any changes to the President’s policy toward Israel and Gaza as a result of yesterday’s strike?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, I can say that nothing has changed, and we’ve been clear about that since — certainly, since yesterday.  We are going to continue to have those really tough conversations — right? — important, tough conversations about how Israel — Israel moves forward with their operation.,We want to make sure that civilians are kept safe, that — are protected — and also folks who are providing humanitarian aid.  The President was very, very clear.,He also said in his statement that Israel needs to do more.  We’ve been very clear about that as well.  We’re going to continue to have those conversation with our Israel cou- — counterparts.,And — and, look, your — you know, this is important to this President.  But I will also add: That’s why the hostage deal is so critical.  That’s why the President has been working 24/7 along with his — with his team to get that hostage deal done.,And if we get a hostage deal, it means that we can get more humanitarian aid into Israel — I’m sorry, into Gaza — pardon me — and also means that we get to a — a ceasefire — we get into a ceasefire so that we can get that aid in, so that we can get, also, hostages home.  So, that is what we’re going to continue also to work on.,Q Do you have a progress report on that hostage deal?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a progress report.  You saw in the President’s statement that his team continues to have those conversation in Cairo right now.  That is important.,And he — you know, we — we — wish I can — I wish I can stand here today and say there’s a deal.  But those conversations continue.,We’re — we have made this a priority.  This President has made this a priority to get that hostage deal.  It’s important to get those hostages home to their family.  It’s important to get that humanitarian aid and with a — you know, leading to a ceasefire.,Go ahead.,Q Just one more follow-up on the meeting yesterday.  Dr. Ahmad said that he had handed the President a letter from an eight-year-old orphan girl who is living in Rafah.  Has the President read that letter?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m going to be really careful here.  I’m not going to speak to contents of a private meeting.  Just not going to do that from here.,The doctor speaks for himself.  He’s free to do that.  But we have said we’re going to keep these meetings private so that we gave folks who attended the meeting the — you know, the opportunity to be honest, the opportunity to make sure to have a safe place to share their thoughts with us.  So, I’m just not going to read out a content of a me- — a private meeting.,Q Well, since he chose himself to publicly disclose that he had shared this letter and the contents of that letter with the media, can you say whether the President has read it?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Again, I’m not going to speak to any content of the — of a private meeting.  That is something that many members who attended — all of them, truly, who attended wanted to — this to be private.  We’re going to keep — we’re going to keep our side to this — our side of the promise.,Q This letter, in part, says, “I beg you, President Biden, stop them from entering Rafah.”  Without getting into his reaction — potential reaction to that, does the White House believe that Israel entering Rafah is something that President Biden can stop?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We’re having conversations — important conversations.  The first one happened virtually.  And, actually, last we- — last week, when the Israeli Foreign Minister was here, obviously, we had a conversation — Jake Sullivan, Secretary Austin, and others had conversations — and that involved the Rafah oper- — operations or Rafah more broadly.  And so, it started then.  There was a virtual conversation on Monday, and it’s going to continue.,Our hope that we can get to a place where we are indeed protecting innocent civilian lives in Rafah.  You heard — you’ve heard my colleagues talk about there’s more than 1 million Palestinians there who ha- — who sought refuge, who are there seeking refuge.  And so, we want to make sure that their lives are protected.,We know that there are Hamas operators there in Rafah.  And so, we want to make sure that Israel is able to, you know, do what it needs to do in getting — in getting those operators, but it is important — Hamas operators, to be more exact — but it is important that we protect those civilian lives — we protect those lives.,So, those conversations are happening, we’re hoping to see — we’re expecting — I shouldn’t say “hoping” — expecting that it’ll happen in person next week.  And that’s what we’re going to work towards.,Q And just on the President’s visit to Baltimore on Friday.  Do you know if he is going to the actual site of the collapsed bridge, and would he be willing to meet with family members of the workers that were killed?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I know there is a lot of interest in the President’s trip on Friday.  The President obviously is very much looking forward to going to Baltimore, being there for the — for the people of Baltimore.,You heard him say he’s going to be there for as long as it takes to make sure that we make them whole again.  We’ll have more to share on what that day — what Friday is going to look like in the upcoming day or so.,Go ahead.,Q Thanks, Karine.  So, what is the accountability that the U.S. wants to see here?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, let’s,let’s,[let] the ongoing investigation happen.  We want to make sure — the President said this — swift.  We want it to — this — it to be swift.  We want it to be — brings to — lead to accountability.  We want it to be comprehensive and to make it public.,And so, I’m not going to get ahead of that.  Want to see what — what the Israeli government says when they do this investigation.  Just want to be really mindful about that.,Q So, you’re not asking for anything specifically to take place?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We want to see the investigation.,Q Okay.  And the changes — can you detail what changes that the U.S. would like to see Israel make as a result?  And what even makes you think that as a result of these recent deaths that they would make changes when —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look —,Q– they haven’t so far?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  And I kind of said this earlier, moments ago.  We are going to continue to have those tough conversations with our Israeli counterparts.  We’re going to continue to make very clear that we have to protect innocent civilian lives.  That is something that we want to make sure is a priority.,As — as Israel is moving forward with the — with their — their operation against Hamas, a terrorist organization, we understand the importance of them doing that, but we want to also make sure that innocent civilians’ life are protected.  And folks who are out there — brave folks — brave people who are out there providing that humanitarian aid, we want to make sure that their lives are protected, those lives are protected.,We’re going to have those tough, tough conversations as we have been.  And so, that’s part of — this is part of it, right?  This is part of di- — diplomacy.  This is part of having honest, real, frank conversations.,Q And — and in respect to those conversations, John Kirby said earlier today that the White House has made its outrage known about this all the way up to the presidential level.  Aside from the statement that the President released last night, how has the President made his outrage known about this to the Israelis?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, I think the statement that he put out was pretty clear.  Right?  I mean, it showed his outrage.  It showed how he was heartbroken.  That’s the first couple of words in the statement.  He’s outraged.  He’s heartbroken.,And we also laid out what we want to see and the conversations that we have been having.  But it also lifts up the importance of having that hostage deal, getting that done, getting to a ceasefire, getting that humanitarian aid, making sure that those hostages come home to their loved ones.,So, there’s a lot of work to be done.  We’re going to continue to do that work.  But I think that statement made it loud and clear — made it loud and clear where the President stands.,Go ahead, Karen.,QThanks.  Just to go back to bird flu.  Two questions on that.  Has the President been briefed on the cases that have been identified so far?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The President has been briefed.  Yes.,Q Okay.  And in your answer earlier, you had focused on the health aspect of it.  But the nation’s largest producer of eggs has temporarily stopped production at plants in Texas and Michigan because some chickens had tested positive.  What are the concerns about supply chain issues and price increases?  And is there something the administration can be doing or should be doing right now to limit the potential impact on economic activity?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, obviously, any economic impact is something that we closely monitor.  So, we’re going to closely track that, closely monitor the — monitor that.,As it relates to that particular company, I would refer you to CDC on exactly what they’re doing and — and what ha- — what is happening there specifically.,But we’re always going to assess.  (Reporter sneezes.)  We’re always going to keep a — keep — God bless you — we’re always going to monitor — monitor the economic impacts of any — any big changes like that or any changes like that.,But, obviously, one of the most important thing for this administration is the health and safety of American public, and so that’s how — we take that very seriously.  That’s how we’re going to operate.  That is the number-one thing here.  And CDC is — is been working with rele- — relevant agencies to make sure that we — we keep the American public protected here.,AIDE:  Karine, you got to go soon.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hmm?,AIDE:  You need to go soon.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, my goodness.,Go ahead.,Q Thank you.  First, the — so, you guys started draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to try and help with the Putin price hike a few years ago, said you were going to refill it, but now it doesn’t seem like that’s happening.  Why?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, from — I believe the Department of Energy is — is responsible for — for that particular component — is refilling — refilling that.  So, I would refer you to Department of Energy.  I know there were certain components to that and how they were going to move forward in refilling — refilling it.  I — they would have more specifics on that for you.,Q Okay.  And why isn’t federal immigration law tougher on border crossers who come here and are accused of serious crimes?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, are you speaking of a specific case?,Q There’s the story in New York: an eight-person crew of border crossers found with drugs and guns, six of them now are out on bail.  Does President Biden think policies like that are making the country safer?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I want to be really careful.  That’s an active case.  So, don’t want to comment on an active case.,But anyone found guilty — and we’ve been very clear about that — anyone found guilty of a crime should be held accountable.  We have been very, very clear about that.  And if a — if a person poses a danger to a community, they should be detained pretrial.,Q So, more generally, then, do you guys think that some big cities in this country have liberal DAs that are too soft on crime?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, what I will say is — and I’m not going to speak to every state or city here; I — it’s not for me to speak to — we have been very clear about this: Anyone who commits a crime and is found guilty needs to be held accountable.  That’s what this Pr- — the President believes.,And we are certainly very much — we welcome local law enforcement support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals in this country who pose a risk to our national security or also public safety.,If they are found guilty, they should be held accountable.  That’s our — that’s where we stand on this.,Q In the back, perhaps.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Go ahead.,Q Yeah, thanks, Karine.  Two questions.  One is you referred to the President being outraged by the strike on aid workers.  And in the past, the President has also referred to indiscriminate bombing.  I — I’m wondering if you can articulate why, thus far,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there has been no consequences and — and why there are no consequences.  So, beyond (inaudible) —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I want to be clear: It’s — it’s not me referring to that.  This is the President’s statement.  I’m just lifting up the statement from last night —,Q Yeah, I understand.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — where he says, “I am outraged and heartbroken” — the first — the first, basically, line — part of the first line of the President’s — President’s statement from last night, and it speaks for itself.  And he talked about how — he talked about how there’s more that needs to be done to protect cin- — innocent civilians in Gaza.,Q But can you articulate why —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q– there have been no consequences thus far for any types of behavior that the President has been outraged by?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we’ve had — we are having conversations with the Israeli government.  We’ve been very clear about that.  Those conversations have been tough.  We’ve been very public about those conversations.,On this particular incident, there will be an investigation.  There is an investigation currently happening.  The President has said he wants it to be swift, he wants it to be comprehensive, and he wants to — there — to see accountability, to bring account — account — right? — to bring accountability.  He said that in his statement.  And he wants to make sure that it is public.,So, we’re going to let that process move forward.  And, you know, you said it yourself, the President also has been publicly clear here about what — how he feels about what he has seen.,We do not want to see innocent civilians die here.  We do not want that.  And we’re going to continue to be clear and have those conversations, from the President on down, with our counterparts in — in the Israeli government.,And those conversations are tough.  Right?  You think about Rafah — the Rafah operations.  We’ve been clear about that, how — where we stand: that a military operations is not the way to go.  There are alternative ways of getting those Hamas operators in of- — in Rafah.,That’s why we had a meeting — a virtual meeting on Monday.  That’s why we’re going to have an in-person meeting with the Israeli government.,The person ta- — the President takes this very seriously.  He wants to make sure that innocent civilian lives are protected, including those humanitarian aid workers who are out there.  And yes, he’s outraged and he’s heartbroken by what happened yesterday.,And we’re going to have those conversations with the Israeli government, as we have been.  It’s going to continue.,Q If I can also go back to something that was asked earlier —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q– about the President meeting with any aid workers or anybody who has been inside of Gaza since October 7th.  It is a question I’ve also privately posed to —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q– some of your colleagues, and it feels like a yes-or-no question, whether or not he’s actually met with somebody who’s been inside.  And — and the reason I’m asking is a number of people at the meeting said, to their knowledge, this was the first time the President had actually —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q– spoken to anybody who’s been inside of Gaza since October 7th, and I just wanted —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We- — well, here’s what I can tell you.,Q– to confirm that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He’s met with community leaders who are, obviously, from the Muslim community, the Arab community, Palestinian community.  I would let them speak for themselves on if they’ve been to Gaza.,You know, I don’t have any — we don’t have any information to share about that.  We want to be really mindful that the — this meeting and many meetings that we’ve held — had have been private.  We want to respect that.,And so, just going to leave it there.  I think what is important, though — like, I understand the question —,Q I’m saying —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Wait.  No, no, no —,Q– is he getting updates —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, no, no.,Q– from, you know, what the situation tangibly looks like?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, I — no, I understand.  Right?  I — I get what you’re saying, the — the importance of hearing from folks who have been on the ground in Gaza.  I totally understand that.,But I think it’s also important that the President is hearing directly from the community — directly from the community who are — some of them are personally affected by what’s happening in Gaza.  Right?,And so, the fact that senior White House officials are having those conversations — tough conversations is important.  The — the fact that the President has done so as well is important.,But I — I hear your question.  But we are also hearing from folks from the community, having these sit-down conversations.,The community leaders that were here yesterday and met with the President and the Vice President, they asked for a working group conversation, and we listened, and we made that happen.  And the President heard directly from them what they are going through, what they see, how painful it has been for them.,So, I think that’s important as well.  We can’t — we can’t not, you know, lift that up as well.,Go ahead.,QThank you, Karine.  Just while you’ve been up there, there’s been some reporting that Biden is going to speak to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow.  Can you confirm,— confirm that?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have a call to confirm at this time.,As you know, the President and — and the Prime Minister have spoken several times — more than, I believe, two dozen times — since October 7th.  And — and I’ve said this already: His — both — both administration, both governments talk to each other, their counterparts talk to each other every day.  Just don’t have anything to confirm at this time.,Q And on — on Uganda.  A court upheld the anti-LGBTQ law that would mean pri- — prison sentences for people who support gay rights in that country.  I just wanted to see if you have anything from the podium to say about that.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, a couple of things.  The announcement that some provisions of Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Act have been removed by the constitution- — constitutional court is a small and insufficient step towards safeguarding human rights.,The United States is deeply concerned about the remaining provisions, which undermine public health, human rights, and Uganda’s international reputation.,As the President has said time and time again, no one should have to live in constant fear nor be subjected to violence or discrimination.  It is wrong.,We will continue to work to advance respect for human rights for all in Uganda and also around the world.,Okay.  I’m going to take a couple more —,Q I just have one — one question.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, sure.,Q Sorry.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Sure.,Q On — just going back to the LNG piece for a moment.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q I think, everybody in this room, we have a sense for how the President personally feels about Ukraine and Ukraine funding, and he’s made it abundantly clear over the course of two years.,This LNG temporary pause doesn’t have as high of a ho- — pro- — profile.  And can you give any sense for what it is that the President — why he cares so much about it, whether he has shared with you any sort of deep views that he has on this particular very, kind of, targeted policy?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.  So, look, the pause on the pending approvals of LNG export, it is important.  It’s — and it is important to understand the climate and economic impacts — that’s why it’s so important, right? — of these LNG exports.  And it — and it is the impacts on consumers — right? — the impacts on communities.  And that’s why w- — the President supports these LNG pauses.,So, we’re going to continue to meet our LNG needs of our allies.  And the temporary pause does not impact current LNG exports.  But there is some- — by having these pauses, it does tell us something that is important to know.  And so, that’s why the President supports it.,As it relates to what we’ve been hearing from the Speaker — Speaker Johnson, we’ve been very clear: In order to — if we really want to help the people of Ukraine, the brave people of Ukraine, we got to get that national security supplemental done.  He has to put that on the floor.  It will get overwhelming bipartisan support.  We know that to be true.  That’s how we can help the people of Ukraine.,Q I guess what I’m trying to say: Is the Pr- —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah.,Q Is the President personally invested in this ban — or this temporary pause the way he is —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Yeah, abs- — I mean, look, when we talk about the existential threat of climate, this is something that the President has said it is — it is incredibly important to deal with this emergency.  And he has done more — taken more robust action than any other president.  This is part of this.  Right?,And so, the President has been — not just talked about it but has taken action.  So, I would look at this as part of the action that he’s taken to deal with climate — the climate crisis.  And, you know, it is a — it is indeed a crisis.,When he walked into this administration, he talked about four crises that we had to deal with as — as Americans.  And climate change is not just as Americans, as a world.,And so, climate crisis was one of them.  And he’s taken action, and he’s going to continue to do that.  And he’s been robust.  He’s — it’s been comprehensive — more than any — any other president.,Q This just serves as, like, a smaller piece to that —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  But it’s —,Q– larger —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It’s a — I would — I would put it together in that larger piece.  Yes, it’s a smaller piece of the — of, obviously, the — the larger initiative of what we’re trying to do, but it’s also critical.  It’s important.,And, look, the reports that are out there, as it relates to Speaker Johnson, they are not true.  We know how — the best way to get assistance for Ukraine is to pass that national security supplemental.  That’s what we want to see.  It’ll — it’ll get done in an — overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way.,Go ahead.,AIDE:  Karine, (inaudible).,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I know, I know.  Go ahead.  I got to go.,Q Thanks, Karine.  On the World Central Kitchen strike.  I mean, is there concern that this complicates the temporary pier project that — you know, does it make this effort more challenging?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  The pier?,Q Mm-hmm.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, the Department of Defense will have more — an update on the pier.  We’re going to continue to move forward with that.,Look, the President — when the President said he’s going to do everything that he can to get that important humanitarian aid into — into Gaza, in to — to the people — the Palestinian people, innocent civilians here, he meant it.,And so, you’ve seen us do the — the airplane drops.  You- — we’re — in a couple of weeks, it’s going to be — we’re going to have that temporary pier.  We’re going to continue to work with Israel to get those trucks in.,We understand the dire situation that is currently happening in — in Gaza, and we are going to do everything that we can to get that aid in.  This is why the hostage deal is so important.  This is why we’ve been working 24/7 to get that done — get that humanitarian aid, get that ceasefire, and get American — American hostages as well as all hostages home to their loved ones.,I have to go, but we will see you tomorrow, guys.  Thank you so much.,Q Thanks, Karine.,Q Thank you.,1:36 P.M.

2024Q2,0.20063697,0.73995507,0.059407942,Presidential Actions,"The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington, DC 20500,America was founded on the idea that all people are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.  Today, we champion the equal rights and dignity of the millions of Americans on the autism spectrum, and we celebrate the immense contributions of all neurodiverse people, whose perspectives and experiences make America a richer Nation.,Some 5.4 million American adults and 1 in 36 children have been diagnosed with autism.  Their experiences with the condition vary widely, but their talents and potential are too often misunderstood or overlooked.  Autistic people routinely face unnecessary obstacles to securing employment and health care and children face bullying and barriers to education.  We can work to end these disparities and ensure they have an equal opportunity to reach their dreams by making sure that people with autism and those who support them have the resources and tools they need to communicate, grow, work, and achieve greater independence.,Early diagnosis can make a big difference, which is why my Administration is funding groundbreaking research to boost access to diagnoses and services that can help autistic people of all ages thrive.  The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services are also working to ensure that young children with disabilities, including autism, have access to high-quality, inclusive early childhood programs so that they can thrive as well as helping schools leverage Medicaid to deliver critical health care services.  Further, my Administration released guidance on how schools can obtain, use, and support assistive technology devices that are essential to the success of some people with disabilities. Meanwhile, the Department of Education is helping public schools avoid discriminatory discipline for autistic students, whose needs can be misunderstood, while also working to get students with autism and their teachers the resources they need to thrive.  We are working to boost understanding among community members who can help keep people with autism safe — I was proud to sign a reauthorization of Kevin and Avonte’s Law, expanding training for first responders and caregivers.,My Administration is also making it easier for all Americans to get the health care they need.  We protected and strengthened the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, expanding health care coverage to millions of Americans.  At the same time, we lowered health insurance premiums by $800 per year for millions of Americans.  Through the American Rescue Plan, we provided $37 billion to make it easier for people with disabilities, including autism, to receive the services they need at home and stay active in their communities.  My Budget requests another $150 billion over the next decade to further expand and improve these life-changing services.,We owe everyone in this country a fair shot at the American Dream, so we are also working to increase job opportunities for autistic and other historically marginalized Americans who have been shut out for too long.  My Administration is providing State and local governments, private companies, and nonprofits with Federal funding to hire more Americans with disabilities, including those with autism.  I signed an Executive Order to make the Federal workforce more inclusive, and I eliminated the unjust use of sub-minimum wages for people with disabilities by Federal contractors, working to ensure every American has equal protection under the law.,Globally, we are advancing disability rights as part of our work to promote democracy, prosperity, and inclusion.  We are prioritizing disability rights in policy discussions with other nations, and we are working through the United States Agency for International Development and as co-chair of the Global Action on Disability Network to stand for the dignity and equal rights of people with disabilities worldwide.,Diversity in all its forms is one of America’s greatest strengths.  Today, we recommit to making the promise of America real for every American on the autism spectrum, upholding our most basic values of decency, fairness, and respect.,NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2024, as World Autism Acceptance Day.  I call upon all Americans to learn more about autism to improve early diagnosis, to learn more about the experiences of autistic people from autistic people, and to build more welcoming and inclusive communities to support people with autism.,IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this,first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.,JOSEPH R.

JEAN-PIERRE:  Hey.  Hi.,Q    How was the Easter Egg Roll today?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  How was —,Q    How was the Roll?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I think — thumbs up?,(The Easter Bunny makes a thumbs up gesture.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thumbs up.  Two thumbs up from the bunny.,All right.  Thank you.,(The Easter Bunny departs the Briefing Room.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hi.  Happy Easter.,Q    Are you someone who works here at the White House?  (Laughter.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Oh, hello, everybody.  Happy Easter Monday.,So, I have something at the top for all of you, and I think you’ll be really interested in this.  So, President Biden is scheduled to announce he is revoking the Hatch Act.  So, as a gift to all of you — so, now I can actually take all your questions about 2024.  (Laughter.),Q    Good one.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No?  I thought you would love that.,Q    No.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  All right.  Okay.  April Fools.  April Fools.  April Fools.  It is April 1st.,Q    That’s a pretty good one.,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I — thank you.  I thought was pretty —,(Cross-talk.),MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I thought it was pretty slick of me.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.,All right.  With all — in all seriousness, a couple things at the top.,So, First Lady Jill Biden — Dr. Biden — a teacher for more than 30 years, is continuing her theme of “EGGucation” for today’s White House Easter Egg Roll, transforming the South Lawn and Ellipse into a school community full of fun educational activities for children of all ages to enjoy.,In total, approximately 40,000 people will take part in this year’s event — 40,000 people.,We do want to say a special thank you to the American Egg Board and America’s egg farmers for continuing its more than 45-year history of support for the event and for its donation of 64,000 eggs used on the South Lawn and another 64,000 donated to the Capital Area Food Bank to match the eggs used for the Roll.,And I have some news for you at the top.  I know many of you were asking this question over the weekend.  President Biden will travel to Baltimore on Friday to visit the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, meet with state and local officials, and get on-the-ground — an on-the-ground look at federal response efforts.,The President is continuing to lead a whole-of-government approach to the collapse.,President Biden and his team are working with Governor Moore, the congressional delegation, Mayor Scott, and numerous state and local ol- — officials to reopen the port, rebuild the bridge, and support the people of Baltimore.,Through the unified command, the U.S. Coast Guard is coordinating a complex and highly coordinated effort to remove the wreckage, with resources from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the state of Maryland, and others.,Crane barges are on the scene, supporting the mission. In addition, the Chesapeake 1000, the largest heavy-lift crane barge on the East Coast, which is nearly 200 feet long and can lift 1,000 tons, arrived Thursday night.  And on Saturday, the unified command successfully removed the first piece of wreckage.,Last week, within hours of receiving the request, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced the immediate availability of $60 million in “quick release” Emergency Relief funds for the Maryland Department of Transportation.,We’re also doing everything that we can to help address economic impacts.,On Saturday, the Small Business Administration quickly approved a disaster declaration and will provide low-interest disaster loans to eligible affected business — businesses. Today, the SBA is launching two Business Recovery Centers in Baltimore County.  These centers will support impacted business owners in com- — in completing their disaster loan applications.,The Department of Labor is working with local and state officials to determine how to assist workers out of — out of work due to closure of the port.  Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su is in Baltimore today meeting with stakeholders.,And twice last week, the White House convened a meeting for the Biden-Harris administration Supply Chain,Disruptors,[Disruptions] Task Force to discuss potential impacts on regional and national supply chains.,As the President said within hours of the collapse, this administration will be with the people of Baltimore every step of the way.  We are with you, Baltimore, and we will be there until — until we get this done.,Q    Karine, is he viewing by air, land, and sea, like flying by Air Force One?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We will — we will have more — we will have more information as we get closer to — to Friday.  I think the important thing is the President has said we just — he was going to go as soon as possible.  Now he’s — he is going to go on Friday.  We certainly will have more information to share.  I just don’t have any details at this time.,Go ahead, Will.,Q    Thank you.  So, the criticism over the Transgender Day of Visibility.  The White House said that the President wouldn’t abuse his faith for political purposes.  Does the President think that’s what Republicans are doing on this issue?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, look, just a couple of things. And really, so surprised by the misinformation that’s been out there around this, and I want to be very clear.,Every year, for the past several years, on March 31st, Transgen- — Transgender Day of Visibility is marked.  And as we know — for folks who understand the calendar and how it works, Easter falls on different Sundays — right? — every year.,And this year, it happened to coincide with Trans- — Transgender Visibility Day.  And so, that is the simple fact.  That is what has happened.  That is where we are.,And I do want to say a couple of things, because I think it’s important here.  As you just stated in your question, what we’ve been hearing out there — a lot of misinformation done on purpose.,And as a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American.,Now, sadly — and it’s not surprising, right?  It is actually unsurprising that politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful, and dishonest rhetoric.  It is dishonest what we have heard the past 24 hours.  It is untrue what we heard over the weekend.,And, you know, we — we were, at first — I want to be very clear — confused on their coverage.  We’re grateful that Fox agrees with President Biden about the importance of recognizing Trans Day of Visibility.,And I’ll just quote something that Fox said back in 2021.  They tweeted this.  “Trans Day of visibility is dedicated to celebrating transgender people.  To all the transgender men, women, and non-bari- — binary folk, we see you and stand with you.”,President Biden will never abuse his faith or — for political purposes or for profit.  That is not what this administration is about.  That is not what being a leader is about.,And this misinformation out there is just — it’s just — it’s bad.  And it is dividing — it is caused to divide us.,And I want to say one more quote.  This is what Politico covered.  “Every year” — and I said this at the top of my answer — “Transgender Day of Visibility is on March 31st.”  This year, March 31st just so happens to be also Easter, the date of which changes every year.  That’s how I started out.  And that’s how I’ll end.,Q    Thank you.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Why are the U.S. and Israelis meeting virtually today instead of having that in-person meeting on Rafah?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as you know, I can confirm that there is a virtual mee- — meeting happening today with both U.S. officials, Israeli officials to discuss Rafah — the situation in Rafah and, obviously, the next steps that we have been hearing that the Israeli government wants to take.,This is — this is following the discussions that we — we all talked about last week with the Israeli Minister of Defense and his delegation.  And this conversation today is being led by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.,Look, I think it’s important to note that we were rea- — we were able to reschedule this on Friday.  And we wanted to move very quickly on this.  And, today, the meeting is happening virtually, because we understand — and, obviously, you all understand — how important it is to have this conversation.,We have been very clear about our concerns about a military operation into Rafah.  We know that there are more than a million Palestinians who are in Rafah right now, who moved from the north to go into Rafah.,And so, we want to make sure, if there is going to be a military operation — we also know that there are Hamas operators in Rafah as well — but if they are going to move forward with a military operation, we have to have this conversation.  We have to understand how they’re going to move forward.,We — and I’ll say one more thing.  When Jake Sullivan was here at the podium not too long ago, he believed and he said there are alterniv- — alternative ways of doing this –alternative ways of going after Hamas.,And so, they’re going to have the discussion.  I think it’s important that it happen as quickly as — as it did, even though it’s virtual.  And we’ll certainly have more to share.,Q    Are there still in-person meetings planned and, if so, when this week?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We — we will have more to share on the next steps.  We’re going to have a readout of this conversation.  But I think — rescheduled on Friday.  Today, Monday, we’re having a conversation.  We have laid out our concerns about this for some time.  And I think it’s important that both sides are having this discussion.,Q    And just lastly, Speaker Johnson said there will be a vote on Ukraine soon when the House comes back from recess.  But he said it would include some “innovations,” like making some portion of it a loan.  If that’s the only way to get Ukraine aid passed, would the President sign that kind of bill?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get into hypoth- — hypotheticals here.,We’ve been very clear.  We believe if the Speaker were to put the national security supplemental on the floor — obviously, it includes Ukraine, humanitarian aid, Israel, the Indo-Pacific — we believe and it is fact that it would get majority bipartisan support on — on the floor in the House.,We saw, 70 to 29, it passed out of the Senate — bipartisan support — overwhelming bipartisan support.  We believe it would get overwhelming bipartisan support if he would put it on the floor.  That’s all he needs to do.,And so, that’s what we believe the — the Speaker — how it should be moved forward.  I’m just not going to get into hypotheticals.,Go ahead.,Q    Do you expect specific decisions to come out of the Rafah meeting today, Karine?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m not going to get ahead of the meeting.  We will have a readout of — of that meeting.  I’m just not going to — I’m not going to get ahead of it.,Q    And then, secondly, the — the Israelis bombed Iran’s consulate building in Damascus today.  It apparently killed an Iranian military commander.  Did you know about this in advance?  Are you concerned this is an escalation?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, I’m aware of the reports.  Our team is looking into it.  So, I’m not going to get ahead of anything just yet.  But, obviously, we’re aware of the reports, and our team is looking into it.  I’m just not going to go beyond that.,Q    And then, lastly, if I could, do you have an update on how to pay for the new bridge?  Have you — have you had conversations with House Republicans about this?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as — as I mentioned at the top, we — Department of Transportation was able to release $16- — $60 million, which, obviously, is going to be really important — a kind of a down payment, if you will, on getting — on dealing on — on getting that bridge rebuilt.,We’re going to have continued conversation with the state of Maryland to get a sense of how much this is going to cost.  And we have said we’re going to certainly continue to talk to Congress to get some assistance here.,The President has been very clear.  He’s going to be there for the people of Baltimore.  This is a whole-of-government approach, and we are going to do everything that we can to make sure that that bridge gets back up.  I don’t have anything further to share on congressional conversation.  But that’s a commitment that the President has made.,Go ahead.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  “60 Minutes” reported last night on a connection between anomalous health incidents and a unit of the Russian military intelligence service.  What’s the White House’s reaction to that reporting?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I’m going to be really careful here.  The intelligence community has not concluded that.  Obviously, there was an assessment that intelligence community made.  And so, I would have to refer you to the — to ODNI on their assessment.  But that particular piece about Russia — I know that they had not concluded that.,Q    Right.  And I know that the — the intelligence community has said that it’s — they still think it’s un- — not likely that a foreign power is responsible.  How can the administration continue to believe that when you have so many credible U.S. officials who have experienced this saying otherwise?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, this is an intel- — intelligence community assessment.  ODNI can speak specifically on how they got to that assessment, how they got to that conclusion.  So, I want to be super mindful.,What I can speak to is what we have done since 2023 since the intelligence committee assessment.  And we have taken this very seriously.  The President takes U.S. personnel — making sure that they are protected is the most important.,A couple of steps that we took: We prioritized investigations into the cause of AH- — AHIs and to examine reports thoroughly.,Now, this is something that the President directed the departments in the federal government — obviously, across the federal government — to do: ensure that U.S. government personnel and their families who report AHIs receive the support and timely access to medical care that they need and — and to take reports of AH- — AHIs seriously and — and threat to personnel with respect and compassion.,So, we have taken some actions that will — that — that the President directed his agencies across the federal government.,At — any specifics to the intelligence assessment, I would have to refer you to ODNI.,Q    And the Pentagon confirmed another aspect of “60 Minutes” reporting today, that a Department of Defense official who was in Vilnius for the NATO Summit last year also experienced what appears to be AHI.  Can you give us any update on that person’s condition?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have any update.  I’m very careful about speaking to any personnel-specific case.  So, I can’t — I don’t want to do that from here.  I would have to refer you on Department of Defense, since that came from the Department of Defense.,Q    Bottom line: Are U.S. officials who are working on issues related to Russia — particularly overseas — are they safe?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of prioritizing — right? — making sure that personnel are, you know, protected.  And we are going to do everything that we can.  This is something that this President believes is important.,And so, look, we’re going to get to the — we’re going to continue to do a comprehensive examine — examination of the effects here that we’re seeing and the potential causes of AHI.  That’s something that we’re going to continue to look into.,And, look, we take this very seriously.  We take this very serious.  This is why we have taken an all-of-government approach and — and have directed agencies to do the three things that I listed out.  And, you know, it — this is — this is important.  We see this as a — as — as a important issue that we want to — to, certainly, prioritize.  And that’s what we have been doing since 2023.,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you.  Is the President hosting an iftar dinner tomorrow?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, I don’t have anything to confirm here.  As you know, very early on this month, we put out a statement marking the first day of Ramadan.  This is March, obviously, we did that.,The President wishes all who observe Ramadan a safe, healthy, and blessed month.  In his statement, he spoke to the appalling resurgence of hate and violence towards Muslim Americans.  He also spoke to the need to secure a ceasefire as part of a hostage deal in our efforts to signif- — significantly increase humanitarian aid into Gaza.,And that’s something that you’ve heard us talk about.  You’ve heard us actually take actions in the past couple of weeks, whether it’s the pier, whether it’s the plane drop and working with Israel, obviously, to get that — increase the humanitarian aid.  And so, we’re going to continue to do that.,We don’t have — I don’t have anything to — to share with you at this moment.,Q    But if he does host an iftar dinner, would you announce that in advance the way you do for Hanukkah gatherings —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I —,Q    — or other kinds of gatherings?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I just don’t have anything to share on — on an event com- — an upcoming event at this time.  I just don’t have anything to share.,Go ahead.,Q    On LNG and Ukraine aid.  Can you say, is the President open to suspending the pause on — the administration’s pause on — on new LNG approvals in exchange for Ukraine aid?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, as we said repeatedly, the House needs to pass the bipartisan national security supplemental.  I’ve been saying that.  It was the first thing I said when I came to the podium — one of the first things.  And we want to see that as soon as possible.  We know it would get bipartisan support overwhelmingly if it were to go to the floor of the House.  That’s what we want to see.,As I stated, it’s already passed the Senate 70-29.  So, it’s important to move forward.,And we’ve also talked about — Jake Sullivan has talked about, my National Security Council colleague has talked about this as well — is that we — or Ukraine can’t afford any more delays.  We have seen what’s been happening the past several weeks, the past several months in Ukraine.  They are losing ground on the battlefield.,Q    So, are you saying it’s still on the table?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, what I’m saying is that we have to pass the bipartisan national security supplemental.  That’s what we want to see.  If we want to —,Q    All right.  So, you can’t say if Biden is — is willing to —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  We — look —,Q    — make that exchange?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  This is — this is where we are at this moment in time.  We want to make sure that national security supplemental is moved forward.  It could get bipartisan support.  We know it will.  We know it would get overwhelming support if they put it on the floor, right?,And Congress’s inaction has led to Ukraine losing footing in the battlefield.  That’s what we’ve seen.  That’s what we’ve seen.  And so, Congress needs to act.  It is — in order to actually deal with this, in order to give Ukraine — the Ukrainians what they need, the brave Ukrainians on the ground what they need —,Q    So, can you say if the President is open to (inaudible) with the Speaker?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I’m just — I’m just not going to negotiate from the podium.  That’s what we — we’ve always been very clear from that — from here.  I’m not going to get into hypotheticals.,We know what needs to be done.  And what needs to be done is to put that national security supplemental — passed out of the Senate in a bipartisan fashion, 70 to 29 — we believe it can get passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan fashion in the House.  I just want to be mindful and not get into hypotheticals from here.,Go ahead.,Q    On the reporting about the health incidents.  Because a lot of these concerns and incidents are happening on the President’s and Vice President’s trip, do you know if the President or Vice President have met with anyone who has been impacted by any of these health concerns?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No, it’s a good question.  I don’t have — I don’t have any readout or any conversations to — to say or to speak to at this time.,Q    And then, these officials are saying they’re speaking out because they don’t agree with the ODNI assessment.  Is the President going to, you know, implore Director Haines to look at these claims more closely?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I mean, there was a nat- — an assessment that was done, as you just stated in your — in your statement — in your question to me.  I would have to — we trust our — our intelligence community, right?  And they put out an assessment.  So, I would have to refer you to ODNI.  I can’t get into any sp- — more specifics than that.,Q    So, the President is standing by that assessment and —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  It is —,Q    — that’s the end of the road?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  He is standing by the assessment.  I would have to refer you to ODNI.,Go ahead, April.,Q    Karine, I have two different subjects related to one topic.  When it comes to the Baltimore port, is the President or Democrat- — or are you hearing from Democrats, particularly in this building, that there’s a concern that Republicans aren’t moving in an expeditious fashion?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Look, I can’t — I can’t speak to that right now.  What I can speak to: what the President has been doing.  He has said he’s going to use a whole-of-government approach.  You heard the Department of Transportation — you heard me at the top say that $60 million has been provided to get that bridge done.,And, look, we’re going to do everything that we can to get the port open as soon as possible, obviously, to build that bridge as — as soon as possible.  The timeline is going to be complicated.  It is a complicated scenario.  So, I don’t have a timeline on that.,Look, we’re going to have conversations with congressional members.  We’re going to, certainly, talk to them on what else is needed, if there is additional funding — there is going to be additional funding needed to get this done.,I’m not going to go into — into specifics at this time.,Q    Are Republicans invited to the White House this week or next week to talk about this?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I don’t have any schedule about any congressional conversations here happening at the White House.  But I would say the — you know, our — our Leg Affairs — White House Leg Affairs has regular communication with — with congressional members.  Department of Transportation, as well, has regular communication with congressional members.  And so, that’s going to continue.,I just don’t have a — a formal — a formal meeting to be happening here —,Q    And the —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  — on this particular issue.,Q    And the next subject that’s related to this.  After all of us — the world watched how that cargo ship — that multi-hundred-ton barge ran into the pillar, is there a concern about assessing bridges that deal with these kind of things around the nation?  Has there been talk about that?  Because this was — yes, it was catastrophic, but this government seems to be very reactionary.  When something happens, it jumps on to try to fix it.  And —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Which I think is a good thing.  I think, when something happens, the fact that this administration jumps on top of it and tries to make sure that we don’t forget the communities, we assist, and we get communities put back together — right? — the — the bridge is something that the Balti- — people of the — Baltimore are feeling very acutely.  And so, we’re going to, certainly, do everything that we can to get that bridge back up and to get the port open.,Look — but as you’re asking me about bridges and — and, certainly, infrastructure —,Q    Throughout the nation, that’s (inaudible).,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  No — but that’s why the bipartisan infrastructure legislation was so important.  Let’s not forget, that infrastructure law is now going to really deal with infrastructure in a generation.  It is something that is a — an investment in our infrastructure, not just bridges.  We’re talking about tunnels.  We’re talking about roads, right?  We’re talking about broadband, right?,These are incredibly important.  And creating jobs — creating good-paying union jobs.,And so, that is what the President has said he was going to do.  The last administration turned it into a joke.  It was Infrastructure Week every week, and he did absolutely nothing.,And so, this administration was able to get a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law done.  And so, we are — we are proud to have been able to do that.  Obviously, it’s going to speak to the bridges. It’s going to speak to bridge- — to — to roads and tunnels.  And I think that’s important that that was able to get done within the President’s first term.,Go ahead.,Q    Thank you, Karine.  International doctors has been describing horrific scene at the Shifa Hospital.  Three hundred bodies were found.  Some were tied up and executed, including doctors, women, and children.  Is the White House calling for an independent investigation?  And second, do you believe that Israel is in violation of international law?,And just on another topic.  The Israeli Knesset, the parliament, just passed a law banning international media from working in Israel.  You always call Israel as an ally that you share values with.  Is this a value that you share with?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, a couple — you asked me two very important questions, and I want to get to — to them.,So, as it relates to — and I think you were speaking specifically — at least the reports that we’ve seen — is about Al Jazeer- — Jazeera, specifically.  But it doesn’t matter, whichever — right? — journalists more broadly.  But at — to those particular report, we’ve seen the reports, and, certainly, I’m going to refer to Israel for what they may or may not be considering.,But it — if it is true — if it is true, a move like this is concerning.  We believe in the freedom of the press.  It is critical.  It is critically important.  And the United States supports the critically important work journalists around the world do.  And so — and that includes those who are reporting in — in the conflict in Gaza.,So, we believe that work is important, the freedom of the press is important.  And if those reports are true, it is concerning to us.,And to your first question.  So, look, Hamas should not — should not be operating out of hospitals — we have said that — we’ve said that over and over again — and putting civilians at risk.  That’s what we’re seeing.  And we are concerned by how Hamas appears — they appear to have been able to reconstitute in a hospital so quickly.,So, we’ve always ma- — also made clear that we continue to support Israel’s right to defend itself.  But — but as we’ve also said, we do not want firefights in a hospital where innocent people — people — helpless people, people seeking medical care are caught in the — in a crossfire.  We don’t want to see that.,We have urged Israel to take every step to avoid civilian casualties.  And this just points to how challenging Israel’s military operation is because Hamas has intentionally embedded themselves into — into civilian infrastructure, into these hospital.,And so — and so, we’ve been very clear.  As — as it relates to the footage, as it relates to the photos and recordings, we have not verified that photo- — footage.  We’re — we’re going to be reaching out to the Israeli government to get more information.,But obviously, if these reports are true, that is indeed deeply concerning.,Q    But this difference between the civilized world and uncivilized world is sticking to international law at the time of war.,So, regardless, even if these people were Hamas, do you believe that under international law Israel has the right to execute people, even if Hamas, which you consider a terrorist organization — regardless, you can hold them to the same standard as a professional army that often the White House praise as a professional army, they know what they’re doing, and even sometimes you said, “I wish the U.S. Army behaved like the Israelis”?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  I hear your question, and I have said it is deeply concerning if it’s true.  We are reaching out to Israel government to get more information.  And that is also important to do.  We have to make sure that the- — this — what we’re hearing is verified — right? — that the footage is also verified.,But we’ve been very clear.  Like, this is — we also have to call out Hamas here.  They are operating out of hospitals — out of hospitals.  That’s what they’re doing.  They’re embedding themselves in civilian population.  This is what they’re doing.  And so, we have to be, also, very clear about that.,And we have said we’ve urged Israel to take every step that they — to avoid civilian casualties.  So, we’re going to re- — we’re going to reach out to the Israeli government, get more information on that.  And it i- — if that is indeed the case, it is deeply concerning.  It is deeply concerning.,Go ahead.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Just kind of going back to the LNG pause for a minute.  In January, when the pause was announced, the President put out a statement, and he said, “This pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time.”,Does the President still believe that that LNG pause is so necessary?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed in our — in our — in our posture on LNG.,Go ahead.,Q    Great.  So —,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Okay.,Go ahead, Jon.,Q    Thanks, Karine.  Back in 2007, there was another deadly bridge collapse.  It happened in Minnesota.  And days after, Congress reacted.  They passed the funding to replace that bridge.  Is the President disappointed that there isn’t that same sense of urgency as it relates to the Key Bridge in Baltimore?,MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, what I can speak to right now — in this time, in this moment — is the — what — what the President has promised: a whole-of-government approach here — response.  That’s what you’ve seen.,The Department of Transportation was able to provide $70- — $60 million.  Just last week, they made that announcement.  You heard me talk about that at the top.  And we will, of course — of course, we are going to work with Congress to ensure that we have the — the resources — right? — needed so that we can make sure that this is fully covered — the rebuilding of the bridge is fully cov- — covered.,I’m not going to go beyond — beyond that.  We’re going to have those conversations.  We’re going to make sure that we are there for the people of Baltimore.  That is the President’s promise.  He said that the federal government is going to fully pay for that.  And he’s going to stand by hi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
